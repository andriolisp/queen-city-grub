3 times for them to clean but it was only grudgingly","our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum","for some measly stale and unseasoned

eat my burger","after the first bite i could tell it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done","all i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it","all and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut ed spinach was good","overpriced for average food","really 5","00 for 1 piece of french toast","ihop is better than this","i usually come to this location but never go back again","server never introduced herself","salad bar was horrible","no utensils for items there i had to let the people know not only did they not replace the food that im quite sure customers were sticking their hands in to get they

and the fried green tomatoes were the best e ever had","the rest of the menu was disappointing unless yoe in the mood for burgers fries and homestyle","last but not least the dessert menu","get the cake","worth the price","we enjoyed our dinner very much great fried chicken and comfort food creamed corn butter beans mashed potatoes ","i had the halibut special with shrimp corn and peppers","the flavors were excellent","ice cold beer and wine and great seats outside rounded out a great dining experience","the fact that the kin kitchen gives back to the community is a plus","i had low expectations of finding authentic chinese food at this chain but was nonetheless disappointed that the lemongrass chicken salad hardly had any chicken and the dressing was more lemon than was lemongrass the asparagus was seriously undercooked the garlic noodles were barely garlicky and the berry ginger shortcake had no ginger","however the fiery wontons were good though pricey at 7 for 6 and our server moua was great","go for the ambiance but not if you actually want any asian flavors","this is one of our favorite restaurants in town","great classic southern dishes and a seasonally adjusted menu with special offerings","they have the best fried chicken and shrimp and grits in town","also the restaurant serves as a great ministry operating as a non profit that looks to hire people who need a second chance in life","all the profits go to feeding the hungry and outreach in the local community","amazing waitresses very funny and attentive","great food definitely with a little twist","many options to try out","i recommend this location though it was hot while we were there","wonderful","best chicken salad i have had in a long time","love the atmosphere but my husband and i were sat at a very small table near the front because the place fills up quickly and they only have large outdoor tables","he enjoyed his pimento cheese pinini but the bacon was a bit overdone","love the idea of the place love the atmosphere and music","ate there for dinner","very disappointed","dining room was uncomfortably warm","table was sticky","fish was underseasoned with too little sauce","grit cake was greasy","vegetables were oily","table service was slow","usually love small local places like that but i will not be returning to jak","if you have the misfortune to be seated in the first banquette on the right be prepared to have your enjoyment of your meal continously interrupted by the wait staff banging their water pitchers right behind your head even if you ask the manager to have them quit","that space was never meant for staff use and it needs to be blocked with a nice plant or a piece of plywood over it so customers can enjoy their evening","funny this review would not post until i raised my review from 2 stars to 3","tha one way to look better","i ordered coconut curry dish when i got it it was dry like the heat in charlotte","i asked them why","they said we only use a curry paste not actually curry","wtf you it says curry meaning it should have curry aka gravy","this place make no sense the manager or the staff does know anything wha going on","the staff has a damn attitude yoe in the damn service industry you need to learn how to handle people no matter what the problem is","if you do like dealing with people then go find another job","astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurants unenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring food","while i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasn t busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson","despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver","and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all","too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive and these too were incorrect","i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to prepare","the waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen staff true professionalism","the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologize","despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect","we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree","that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i don t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary","my entree was entirely forgettable indeed a few days later i have no recollection of what it was ","i do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy","the two word review why bother","we were in charlotte over the weekend and ate here on saturday night","with it being a saturday night and a comic book convention weekend we knew it would be busy","the hostess was very polite","she told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time","once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food at the same time","the server brought our drinks back pretty quickly","another server brought our food out refilled our drinks and got us silverware","our original server passed by when we were almost done eating","he asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously did hear us ask for refills and our check","we had to ask another server for our check","she asked who our server was we did not know his name but did point him out to her","when she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said oh ","i do think i was the first person to have problems with him","he did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks","i left a 10 cash tip and wrote 0 on the bill","the transaction processed through my bank today","the boy who did have time to wait on us added 9 to my bill for a total of a 19 tip which he did not deserve","i tip based on my service","i would never leave no tip even with horrible service","i am very disappointed","i know 9 is not a lot of money to some but again i did not authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill","we had a very bad experience at this place a year ago but wanted to give it a go one last time but we are disappointed that it happened again at the same location","the waitress is very rude and did bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she did bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed btw we were at pf chan from 8 45 pm and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that i have never seen someone talk to a customer","this was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like pf chan","i would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever","i would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us","needs new management","used to be a good place to go but terrible service the last 3 times e gone","they also brought me my check before i was ready to leave","oh well","what can i say","i a subway","a sandwich good fast cheap","so after leaving the gym i decide to pick up a sandwich for dinner at subway","turns out they had no white bread left","the most basic type of bread","the only two options were wheat and honey oat","just ridiculous","now e frequented this subway before and have never come across this problem","how are you the sandwich spot and run out of bread","tha like the pizza place running out of pepperoni","unacceptable","got a salad","there was some confusion as to whether or not we were ordering from lunch or dinner menu","i said i wanted the dinner salad","half a chicken breast 3 raw sliced onions some pico cheese dressing and lettuce","all for 9","49","been a long time since i felt this ripped off going out to eat","for best service and experience request your waitress be kim she is great food will be on time and just the way you want it","just looked at my receipt and saw i was charged 8","25 tax when it should be 1 less","came here initially for the lobster mac and cheese it was probably the only thing i enjoyed here","beware prices are expensive even for lunch","i had a burger and was impressed with it at all the cocktails were anything special and for 10 i would choose beer next time","located in downtown charlotte","this was the meetup location for the enlightened at the ingress abaddon anomaly","it is centrally located","i am a huge panera loyalist so this review is hard to write","this location as well as the location in cmc levine hospital down the street apparently are needing some training as well as system updates maybe","i placed an order online for rapid pick up","it was set to be ready in 10 minutes","17 minutes later i arrived and they had no trace of my order","i showed them the confirmation still up on my phone screen and was told the make it right then and there","fine","i go to the front order breakfast for my mom as well come back 5 minutes later and told we out of that souffl ","il be about 20 minutes for the next batch","i have to be to work in 20 minutes","nothing rapid about this here","then i was told they have a four cheese souffl so i agree to take that instead only to have the woman turn around and tell me they do have that either because thee selling it to someone else","great","i was offered a breakfast sandwich","if i had wanted a breakfast sandwich i would have ordered one","the manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund","this is the second time e had an issue with this location","i wo return but i suggest you fix it soon panera","a special panera","paner menu is standardized so how can one location stand out from the others","by having the best service and friendliest people","also very good attention to cleanliness","will eat here again","the burgers really are some of the best in the city and the dinner menu is generally excellent","i stepped out and tried the portobello lunch sandwich and was pretty underwhelmed","wrong sandwich order was taken they called my name but once i got back to work and opened the box it was the wrong sandwich","i wo be going back","decent food and atmosphere","hostess service is sub par and prices are expensive for both lunch and dinner","lunch sandwiches burgers are 12 lunch plates start at 15","they do have covered outdoor seating","there is nothing special about this place in my opinion","not sure how the sub will be but the staff not

florida spoiled ","bit the fish and chips was excellent","feels like every other panera","food tastes fresh not too expensive","we went here for valentin day brunch","first we were told that there was a half hour wait","miraculously a table showed up for us in the bar","the waitress seemed like she had never waited tables before","we were brought water after a table that sat down after us did","the

give other guests","the food was barely average and the grits notably came out barely warm","the ham was over salted and my fianc omelet special with ham had no ham in it","we will be moving to this area soon and will likely not return to the liberty","go here all the time for business lunches as well as after work drinks","the place is conducive to both offering a busy but open large bar and dining area with ample t and good drink and food specials","the fries here are amazing maybe tha just me","waiters waitresses can sometimes be hit or miss but thats everywhere with turnover being norm

meal","first time i put a review","but wow","exactly","wow ","just amazing hot good tasty","and with the smile","just here for few days but already know coming back tomorrow","this review relates only to the annual oyster feast","we attended the 3rd annual one on october 2nd 2014","price per head was 95","wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill","the wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor","so that whole aspect was a sales pitch","for 95 done buying","the oyster selection was incredible at least in terms of presentation ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country","by the time you returned to your seat you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same","not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor","other selections were fried oysters over breaded and void of any oyster flavor oysters rockefeller fine enough and a clam crostini too fishy after about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers you realize tha it","there is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it and why would there be i 95 so i m going into it thinking it is a meal ","but they do even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal","overall with the alcohol included it is probably at most a 55 a head event

else","you will be back","wonderful cafe and bakery of french delicacies croissants tarts macaroons etc","that is open 24 7 with free wi fi","better than starbucks for in house baked items and crafted

pricey cost","add to that the fact that the 9 glass of wine came from an 8 bottle it was good wine but i do need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction i would say it was just ok ","nothing to

compares","they just melt in your mouth and are so simple but have so much in depth flavor","all the other food is great as well and i a great place to try new dishes including fried chicken skin nachos rocky mountain oysters etc","the drinks are phenomenal as well especially their moscow mule","warning though if you plan to come on a friday or saturday night be prepared to wait up to an hour possibly two for a table inside","i will say though i more than worth the wait","first time patron here and im hooked","we were able to quickly get a table shortly after opening on a sunday however as

the godzilla roll the yellowtail tuna omg sex in your mouth and the dynamite roll","by far the best restaurant and bar in charlotte","i have been going to the soul gastrolounge for 3 years and their entire menu is phenominal","the staff is on point and the only downside is that the wait is often 1","5 2 hours or more but that only speaks highly of the restaurant itself","horrible experience","it was super hot and the lanes are very uneven","i paid for 2 games for 3 people and was super bored and aggravated halfway through the second game","i did not have fun and am rather irritated that i paid 50 for 3 ppl to bowl in heat and on lanes that lean horribly","i summer time why is it so hot inside","like my ball literally goes straight then sloughs off to the left towards the end","never experienced that any other time e bowled at other locations","a waste of my time and money","disatisfied","i will not be back","eclectic fun atmosphere with matching eclectic fun food","the place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters exposed brick walls eclectic light fixtures and a peacock over the sushi bar","it is a bit loud but the dj spun music is good","the food is a great collection of modern interpretations of regional classics in small plates to share","there are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine but i did have enough room to sample ","with all of this there are also simple kebab options and dip options","then ther the sushi bar and menu","yes eclectic","but tasty and done well","coctails are good wine list is good and the beer list seemed a bit

strawberries","if you are vegetarian you must go to this place","exactly food i really enjoyed the unique atmosphere unfortunately the service was absolutely terrible","i have a job in the food industry for about 4 years so i know wha it like to not be able to attend to a customer right away but when your being ignored right in front of your face is a different story","honestly i would recommend the food to anyone but if your going there looking for good service you should just turn around and walk out the door","place has character and very friendly and professional staff","the only negative thing i could say is about the cleanliness","it does seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest customer even when i not busy","it also does have the sanitary feel to it sanitary grade 96","0 ","i noticed that not all the staff wear gloves hair net hat when handling food","food it self does look taste fresh","i had the noda salad for lunch and it tasted like i been out all day","great location it seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee","however based on my experience i would order anything simply because i would wanna get sick","i kinda like waffle house","if that makes any sense","visited a number of times in the past few years both in small and larger groups","great breakfast all day items and i love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items","love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly","service and professionalism need improvement","on a recent visit we sat outside brought the dog bad

food","though the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant the kitchen performance was also spotty","parts of the meal were freshly made other items ie biscuits and gravy had heavily congealed revealing it had sat ready for some time before it was served","lines happen and kitchens get backed up this is not the issue","i will wait for good food just do make me wait and then serve bad food","the server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server","perhaps something to be dealt with behind closed doors","the only good thing about this place were drink prices","the drinks themselves could be served better","now not one to be a drink sob when you wanna get a good buzz on then serve is however you can","but when you ask for a jager bomb or an irish car bomb then i think their respective shots should drop bomb into the drink","in theory that would happen if the shot was in","say","a shot glass","they served the shot is a plastic medicine cup","that makes it difficult to drink bomb enjoy","the shot was just floating in the pint glass","does anyone remember exxon valdez","plastic is made of oil and oil floats","also one more thing","the music is so damn loud that i ca hear myself think about how loud the music is","i understand","it tries

him my video pics so i did just that","he said h refund my total purchase and to date that has happened","i called last week to speak with the owner","she picked up the phone and was too busy

evacuated management doing nothing in fact they kept serving orders","just ignoring it","fire department 28 min later","waste of time","worst subway ever","bad customer service","watch your meat

stars","only giving one star because the system forces me to in order to post this","went to this location last night i ordered wings and the louisiana gumbo","after a wait of almost 30 minutes the waitress comes over and states they had to redo the wings","five minutes later the manager comes over with the gumbo and says her something to munch on while you wait for the wings i wanted it to come out with the wings ","no real apology was offered just another long wait for wings","and the order was still wrong","we ordered charred wings in two different flavors","came out plain and flavorless","staff seemed to be irritated when it was brought to their attention","manager brought out two bowls of sauce that should have been cooked on the wings and said here try this ","not going to go into the fact of having to ask for extra napkins as well as tea refills","there definitely needs to be some training of staff at this location","a word to the wise spend your hard earned money

give zero stars if possible","walked in to 4 females talking at the front like this was a high school locker party","after being seated we had time to review the entire menu","about three times","it had been close to 10 minutes since walking in and not one person had approached us","yet the conversation remained at the front","completely unprofessional and inconvenient","for the prices they charge for food the service surely does not reflect it","will not go back","manager robert and his staff made our night","our server kareem was fun engaging and attentive","thank you all for your professionalism and making our celebration a success","this is an excellent american pub with a unique menu that often puts a twist on some traditional american food","i am particularly fond of the bacon wrapped meatloaf and is the best i have ever had as it was properly cooked","they have a large selection of beer and drinks","note that this place is often busy and seating can be difficult for parties larger than four people","there is a bar downstairs and one upstairs as well","for large get togethers you can rent the upper floor and it provides ample seating","was a great atmosphere at first","then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost","after not checking if the keys were turned in and initially saying no he began to respond with things like i not my f ing responsibility if you lost your keys i do have your keys you f ing stupid b ch and stop giving me attitude about your keys when she clearly was ","i was standing right next to her and after repeated comments like this heard enough and said hey man the girl lost her keys and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here what is your problem","he immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me what the f k are you going to do about it","something i do think was necessary at all at this point ","he proceeds to call over security who says hey le talk about this over here pointing to a spot away from the bar ","i agreed saying yes le talk about it after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt by an overly aggressive bar tender ","security proceeds to push me out a side door without saying a word","if this is the kind of bar you would like to go to then i highly recommend it","ill give them the benefit of the doubt with the generous 3 star rating as it was somewhat busy and i did sit at a table i the bar area","our server was m","i","a","for the majority of my time there","beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time","bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer","big applause to the hostess who did a fantastic job greeting customers running food bussing tables and trying to smooth over guests","a large thank you to the one server not named ashleigh who stepped in and took care of us and not too thrilled customers around us","food was defiantly on point especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen","that did a lot","our personal server was rude and i understand it was busy i work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother","if it was for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a

our food was bought out in a decent amount of time allowing us to make the game","the food is really good","i typically get the teriyaki chicken and often order the gyoza as an appetizer","the price is a little high so might be better as a date spot","also it is a fairly slow restaurant which makes it hard for lunch during the work week","the sushi was good decent enough service but not excellent","go back again","horrible service","went for lunch today","waited for 45 minutes before being service for my food to come out cold","never received an apology for the wait time only excuses","a server called in sick and this is my problem why","the server roger advised he could remake my food","to my surprise all they did was reheat the plate and put it in a to go container since

this review","in my opinion they deserve nothing","the food was good","i would give it 4 5 if only for food but the service was awful","we sat at the bar","david was the bartender","he was very condescending","he paid no attention to us as he spent all his time not only talking to the girls at the bar but very loudly using horrible language talking to them","he needs to respect others around

attented this resturant few times","at first they treated me as a costumer should be treated","it was until later that i was treated very poorly","maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior e incounter is unacceptable","i would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out","i was patient until i realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress","as a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking","but of course thats just me second when my family i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the kitchen was close and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half before closing time but even then that did much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it was until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me ","they refuse to serve my family i but served them no questions asked","i think not ","an apologe was not even giving to us","thirdly the dj is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song","i as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee","as an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj ","this resturant is a disappointment big time","i would be damned if i step foot here again","i do not recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime","y los precios","que pedo","12 dollars for 2 sprites","this has been our favorite

you are familiar with the brand and layout you know what to expect","the lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful","this hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators which are in the hallways right behind the front desk also used for access to from the lobby and other rooms ","this was definitely a problem during high traffic times you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators","very poor layout in my opinion","otherwise the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a hyatt place so if you like the layout it will be the same","i really like the sitting area i quite large and has a big l shaped sofa and a separate desk","really nice","the only thing i do like about these rooms is the open bathroom area","the sink is basically in the bedroom so i very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready like brushing your teeth without disturbing anyone else who

of my heart thank you","however hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people","it is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people especially at night as well as

dog","the first time i was not charged 75 even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file ","for the record the dog is well behaved","when i asked the manager name","about it he simply told me that it was policy","i told the manager i understood but if there if a policy follow through with it at all times","he removed it but honestly the money did matter","it is more important that i can

fun and interesting atmosphere as well every visit is another great experience","this is only feedback for their cinnamon pretzel","i unpleasant","very thin hollow chalky and not very sweet","give your money to one of the other more deserving competitors in the mall","new 5 oz sliced sirloin with merlo wine mushroom sauce","good steak and plenty of it","grilled asparagus was ok but stems were

on their website of not being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities ","i was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an activity ","this should serve

witnessed several parties walk in that were seated until 10 minutes after","there was a group of young men who were seated that did have a waitress attend to them until 15 minutes after and had not

nicer cooks e ever met jackie who runs the place and is seemingly always there happily smiling as he works under a wall that is almost certainly going to collapse under the weight of the awards the place has won","this is one of those restaurants tucked in to a small unit in a shoping center that only locals know about","i only found out about it because a now ex used to work there and now i

3 times for them to clean but it was only grudgingly","our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum","for some measly stale and unseasoned

and water logged same with the tomatoes","i just moved them aside and started to eat my burger","after the first bite i could tell it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done","all i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it","all and all disappointed the only reason why

was brought out chicken fried steak which she ordered chicken fried chicken","once again the manager came out totally unconcerned about the mishap","my order i placed to go was to have no dressing on

service and food was horrible","as you walk in you are expecting a server to come and sit you down because of the linen tables no one come we stood there for about 10 mins the cashiers were behind the counter and did acknowledge us","this is the first time we came to this place we looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order when our food came out she did bring out the fries we had ordered which you have to pay 1","99 extra for we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we were getting them","we started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way the plantains were cooked either and the rice was cold","it was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us because they were closing as i was filling up my drink i noticed that they were just re heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator","nasty","the food is not fresh and not even cooked all the way and they just re heat everything","never go to this place","i had low expectations of finding authentic chinese food at this chain but was nonetheless disappointed that the lemongrass chicken salad hardly had any chicken and the dressing was more lemon than was lemongrass the asparagus was seriously undercooked the garlic noodles were barely garlicky and the berry ginger shortcake had no ginger","however the fiery wontons were good though pricey at 7 for 6 and our server moua was great","go for the ambiance but not if you actually want any asian flavors","like all p","f","chan they can be busy","what i recommend are reservations","staff we interacted with were great","hostess waiters managers","food was great as well","food is alwasy good service is fast prices are right and the taste are so good","if you go try the plantines","i ordered coconut curry dish when i got it it was dry like the heat in

people then go find another job","worst sweet sour chicken and egg rolls e ever had","egg rolls undercooked","batter on chicken and egg roll taste terrible","hope it was new oil in frier otherwise","if you have the misfortune to be seated in the first banquette on the right be prepared to have your enjoyment of your meal continously interrupted by the wait staff banging their water pitchers right behind your head even if you ask the manager to have them quit","that space was never meant for staff use and it needs to be blocked with a nice plant or a piece of plywood over it so customers can enjoy their evening","funny this review would not post until i raised my review from 2 stars to 3","tha one way to look better","yummy food i got the veggie lo mien and it was very good","my friend got the broccoli chicken i think but the chicken was good quality in my opinion it was all white meat and tasted good very picky about chicken ","our food came out very fast it came out in under 10 minutes of us ordering","our waiter was so sweet and very attentive he even put my leftovers away in a box for me at the table and our drink cups were always full","first time e gone here but i will definitely be coming back","this place is great","my wife and i were in town and decided to try bistro 88","she ordered the basil chicken and i ordered the tangerine beef","we loved every bite","the food was fresh and tasted amazing","we will be stopping by on our next visit and highly recommend that you try it","we had a very bad experience at this place a year ago but wanted to give it a go one last time but we are disappointed that it happened again at the same location","the waitress is very rude and did bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she did bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed btw we were at pf chan from 8 45 pm and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that i have never seen someone talk to a customer","this was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like pf chan","i would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever","i would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us","ive been going here since 2008 i love this place the food is always great and the people are friendly","great food and service","we been coming here for years and is great food and pleasant experience every time","we

us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time","once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food at the same time","the server brought our drinks back pretty quickly","another server brought our food out refilled our drinks and got us silverware","our original server passed by when we were almost done eating","he asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously did hear us ask for refills and our check","we had to ask another server for our check","she asked who our server was we did not know his name but did point him out to her","when she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said oh ","i do think i was the first person to have problems with him","he did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks","i left a 10 cash tip and wrote 0 on the bill","the transaction processed through my bank today","the boy who did have time to wait on us added 9 to my bill for a total of a 19 tip which he did not deserve","i tip based on my service","i would never leave no tip even with horrible service","i am very disappointed","i know 9 is not a lot of money to some but again i did not authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill","astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurants unenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring food","while i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasn t busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson","despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver","and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all","too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive and these too were incorrect","i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to prepare","the waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen staff true professionalism","the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologize","despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect","we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree","that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i don t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary","my entree was entirely forgettable indeed a few days later i have no recollection of what it was ","i do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy","the two word review why bother","needs new management","used to be a good place to go but terrible service the last 3 times e gone","they also brought me my check before i was ready to leave","oh well","what can i say","i a subway","a sandwich good fast cheap","friendly atmosphere and a big open restaurant","we were with a very large crowd for the abaddon ingress anomoly in november 2015","they have a large outdoor dining deck also","the heavy horderves we ate were right on time after a long day","just looked at my receipt and saw i was charged 8","25 tax when it should be 1 less","they were not prepared for the weekend and a lical soccer game","ran out of too many things at least 3 we tried to order early before 10pm on a saturday night","i expect an uptown bar to track events be prepared","went here friday night one of my favorite bars in the uptown area","looked at my credit card bill and was charged 90 even though my tab was 45","called ri r today and the manager took a look into what happened and seemed someone accidently charged my card a 45 tip the manager refunded my money right away","will definitely be going back","thank you","so after leaving the gym i decide to pick up a sandwich for dinner at subway","turns out they had no white bread left","the most basic

abaddon anomaly","it is centrally located","i am a huge panera loyalist so this review is hard to write","this location as well as the location in cmc levine hospital down the street apparently are needing some training as well as system updates maybe","i placed an order online for rapid pick up","it was set to be ready in 10 minutes","17 minutes later i arrived and they had no trace of my

called the waitress over and told her i could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that i wanted and i said no just take it off the bill","now since this restaurant is listed as an upscale restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was","well i guess not as no one came so i guess they do really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket","we also had a cup which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp lobster bisque and there was a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty","we paid the bill but since they do seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again","on the way

place is an authentic soda shop or retro have lived through the 1940 s or 50 s to know what a real soda shop looks like that is checkered marble floors plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors","pikes is none of that","i a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar","so in that regard haven driven thirty minutes to get there we were disappointed","in terms of the food i ordered what was labeled meatloaf on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top","i added a side of mac and cheese and didn t care for that either as there were bread crumbs baked in","my father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad","you of thought they d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place","he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was just fair ","when dinner was over i handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that i d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out","while we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way i said sure and then i asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave","he looks at me right in the face two feet away and says what are you talking about","i said we ve been trying to settle up and can t because you can t process cards","this momo just kept staring at me until we basically got up and i told him to blank the hell off","what a dumbblank anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave","the service as far as drink refills and delivering meals was at the 5 to 10 tip level and no more","1 out of 5 stars ","e only been once","the food is okay but nothing to write home about","i like the concept of the homemade sodas but it is something i want all the

ok and the servers are less than thrilled with life","needless to say nothing is consistent at this place and it is unfortunate because a movie helped guarantee its success so wha the excuse","if you want a quick place to eat with mediocre food and service by all means try this place out","food was great","only complaint is that when i asked about a kids menu i was told we have a kids cheeseburger and grilled cheese got the kids cheeseburger","9","50","i asked about this when i saw it on the bill and was told we do really have a kids menu","do expect a reservation to be honored we waited an hour with a reservation for 2","food was good steak and the brie that came with the cheese plate was the best part of the meal","i was raised on al mik food","zan was a mainstay and very cool mentor to me and everyone else in the restaurant business in charlotte","i spent many nights drinking shots and delicious concoctions in this place","it always reminded me of new york pubs especially in the winter ","the food was always top notch and the best pub food money could buy","when i think of charlotte epic restaurants i think of al mik gus sir beef south 21 the penguin the diamond the knife and fork the coffee cup the liberty holly farms the barclay the cajun queen catherin fenwic the laurel market hotel charlotte red rocks open kitchen and the list goes on","love the atmosphere this place is great in terms of service it really surprised us as we werent sure what to expect","the food is great but holy smokes the beer selection is really solid too","really laid back place","we will be back for sure","very underwhelming","for the price of the mothe day brunch the quality was extremely poor","hash browns were burnt and tasted stale","prime rib was medium rare but still tougher than a 2 steak","oysters you could tell were frozen and were extremely slimy","in the business so i understand the concept of trying to maximize profit but this was just a rip off","40 and 20 for kids i was expecting much much better","we will never return and i would give 0 stars if possible","my wife and i loved their food and drinks","my wife has a gluten allergy and this restaurant was able to offer up some options","in the heart of uptown alexander michaels give a taste of charlotte culture that is filled with flavor and flare","i recommend this place to anyone that is looking to see what the coty is all about","thank you for existing","this review relates only to the annual oyster feast","we attended the 3rd annual one on october 2nd 2014","price per head was 95","wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill","the wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor","so that whole aspect was a sales pitch","for 95 done buying","the oyster selection was incredible at least in terms of presentation ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country","by the time you returned to your seat you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same","not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor","other selections were fried oysters over breaded and void of any oyster flavor oysters rockefeller fine enough and a clam crostini too fishy after about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers you realize tha it","there is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it and why would there be i 95 so i m going into it thinking it is a meal ","but they do even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal","overall with the alcohol included it is probably at most a 55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards","friday happy hour 3 7pm","1 oysters and the fiery muscles are amazing","we usually sit in the bar or patio and drink wine and knosh on happy hour specials","very tasty mexican restaurant","they even give a small dessert complimentary","pleased and

out and ran away my wife and i searched for over 24 hours to no avail we had to continue on due to having to return to work","i stopped into azteca and asked if i could leave my name and number encase anyone seen her","so we drove on with broken hearts","well to my delight at midnight i received a phone call from the night manager saying they found our puppy needless to say we rushed 3 hours back to retrieve our little puppy","to me this shows the character of the employees at azteca and going above and beyond","worst mexican food e ever eaten so bland and flavorless","dried out chicken what a waste of 30","food was not good and service was poor at best","my wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it","the waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay","she replied that it was to her liking that it was very dry bland and not very good at all","the waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes","he removed the dish from the table","he did even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal","we will never eat at this restaurant ever again","my advice would be to look elsewhere for mexican food","ther much friendly and delicious mexican restaurants out there","food is a bit pricey for what you get","do go here hungry and expect a big meal because it is happening","the food was hot service was great and the dished had tons of flavor","this place stands and backs its name properly","go early to seat on time or you would be waiting in line","amazing food","ate with group here on a

healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce","they seated all 8 of us pretty quickly service was good and the food was consistent","positives pretty good salad bar they have spinach","healthy side choices consistently good food","negatives they were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky","first time i put a review","but wow","exactly","wow ","just

through","total horsechit","i will never come here again","the food is amazing the service is even better my wif birthday and the whole restaurant knew it and she was just so happy","our server george

good","ruby tuesday has definitely upgraded their menu","love this rt","the staff is great and the salad bar is always pretty fresh and stocked","the booths in bar area are very close to bar stools and i very snug","do not eat here","terrible service awful food and slow kitchen","manager was nice but her staff is questionable","place needs cleaning","decent beer selection but cocktails are superb","food is very good and they have a sunday brunch buffet that is very good","it will cost you 19","95 and i would say i worth it","on the buffet you will find scrambled eggs grits sausage bacon honey baked ham steak home fries sweet potato fries donuts salami pepperoni cheese assortment pastry assortment flatbread pizza assortment waffles biscuits and gravy mussels and your choice of an a la carte menu item","i went here with my family around 2pm memorial day weekend","there were a total of 7 in my party including my older parents","we asked for a place to sit outside with some shade","i was told by the blond hostess she could not accommodate a large party outside in the shade","she offered us a table inside or suggested we wait until it became cloudy","i had to ask","when did she think it would be cloudy","lol","anyways i told her no thank you i will come back when i cloudy","i was not impressed","now after reading some of these reviews i am happy we went elsewhere","my suggestion to groups of more than two","go elsewhere","wonderful cafe and bakery of french delicacies croissants tarts macaroons etc","that is open 24 7 with free wi fi","better than starbucks for in house baked items and crafted coffee espresso beverages","but this place is pricey","sheeze","i was ready in my kevin hart voice ","my daughter will go all hours of the night to study","however if you

fruit","the french macaron are something else","you will be back","a wonderful blend of cheap chic and upcycled regalia makes this place one of a kind","the real star of the show however is the food","authentic french creations are both expertly prepated and very reasonable","the pastries are freshly prepared and delicious","the baguettes are the best in charlotte possibly all of nc","salted caramel brownies are not to be missed","great beer and atmosphere","i was here for the monday run club","service to get a beer was slow","this is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached not a brewery","if yoe trying to eat here on a budget","do","tha the best advice i suppose","aim away from peak hours for better service and i personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles especially for the price not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up fried chicken but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing and the waffle was nothing special","to make matters worse it was served vertically on a spike without any clear way to approach it","rambling","my general view of the menu is that i focusing too much on being gourmet and not enough on being","well good","another reviewer got it spot on the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas","great and slowly rotating selection of belgian and farmhouse style beers one of the better places for the style in charlotte if tha what yoe into which is what earns it the third star but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd tha used to the cit higher end dining and nightlife","if yoe got money to burn on food or mixed drinks or yoe just here for the beer you could do worse than a night at heist","not the best experience e had at a chil","nobody comes to seat you","there is almost always food or trash all over the floors","they had to redo orders for 3 other tables while we were in there and our food was made properly

helpful and smiling","the decor is just awesome","we will definitely be back next time we are in town","they have those ziosk so one would think i got my table and i can order right no wrong you sit

it back and took 40 mins to get it redone","very poor job done lost my appetite ","horrible","rarely disappointed here","the only thing that bummed me was that i did get a dessert treat reward for my birthday like i usually do","however the drink reward was a very refreshing treat at the right time for me","go check out this place for yourselves","great staff and they know how to make one hell of a sandwich","such a bad service sloppy sandwichs my family owns subway and i know how a sandwich is made then she has the right mind to argue with me","never go here again","good sandwiches and soups

would give it 5 stars but there is always a wait to be seated and the service tends to be a little slow","my favorites are the lemon pepper chicken dijon chicken mushrooms and the legendary monster cookie","i have given this place far too much of my money","great atmosphere it can get a little to much like a sports bar on big game nights for my taste but broadly i a neighborhood beer bar that cares about its customers and makes the regulars feel like thee at home","excellent beer selection and a good food menu if it is a bit on the steep end for the latter","specials most days of the week

there in excess of thirty women were up on top of the speakers on the dancefloor dancing which was absolutely fine and accepted by all staff","however when a male friend of mine got up to dance he was told to get down and leave the venue","a huge double standard and very sexist","when another friend tried to peacefully reason with the secuirty staff simplyto keep our friend in the venue he was suddenly without warning put into a full headlock by the 230 pound staff member","so here we have a placid peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled rammed head first into the floor laid on top of

decorations are very cajun and the food is pretty tasty","the only thing that takes away from this place for me seems to be the uncajun portions","you do get a whole lot for what you pay for here like you would if you were down in louisiana","but if you are looking to try to at least mimic that cajun taste and feel this is a good place to try","the atmosphere is ok","when you first walk i there is barely any space for you to wait to be seated","this is probably like the only restaurant that does offer bread while yoe waiting for food","the table were seated at did seem to be cleaned off well

orders quickly","besides other food 3 in our group ordered gumbo 2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo","the food came out shortly after placing our orders","it was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix up on the gumbos","the person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa","as this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy i address the mix up with the wait staff wh only reply was yes the kitchen gets this wrong all the time ","what","unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind","sorry razzo cajun cafe this could have been a much better review since the food itself was actually fairly good but this kind of mistake is inexcusable","my server was excellent","the rest of the experience was quite awful","when our drinks arrived my glass was broken i mean literally the bottom fell out of the glass my husbands glass was cracked and ready to break","the kids meal consisted of 6 tiny pieces of shrimp and 3 apples","we are in the south where obesity reigns","the management is crappy and overall unconcerned about how we felt","i like ruby

care of your health","i feel bad for this place ","my experience at the dragon court n","tryon charlotte was wonderful","very very reasonable prices with a great selection of dim sum","i thought i had experienced a variety of asian foods until i ate lunch at the dragon court","this restaurant offers a nice family environment with a majority of asians supporting the establishment","dragon court is truly ethnic offering the real deal","loved the food and environment","although the restaurant is located in an old shopping center with a pot hole ridden parking lot you tend to forget about this after entering the dragon court because they offer a clean environment","and great service","i just wish i could find a similar restaurant in georgia","been a few years since i been but ready for a sunday brunch food was awesome","best chinese restaurant in charlotte","this cantonese restaurant offers very delicious dim sum","so much better quality than the other cantonese restaurant named dim

dessert","while we continued to wait","i had water and my cup was refilled once durning the entire hour and a half i was there yes my cup was empty my boys did get a refill until after me","after our waitress came to the table once to apologize for the long wait between ordering drinks and appitizers then our food i finally asked her was there a reason our table was getting such poor service","her response to me was im sorry i had other tables and i had to close a big group out i asked for the manager and explained to him the issue and he had no response or an apology","oh but he comped my appitizers all of ten dollars on an 80","00 bill","they wont be seeing again","i give them a zero","last night was a whole new bad experience","my daughter wanted to treat me to dinner","the hostess

several steaks and sides and a few of their other dishes","very helpful staff as well","love this place","i always clean the staff is awesome and the food has been awesome every time","i am forever a fan","thank goodness the salmon was tasty because we really came for the ribeye which they did have","we then ordered the delmonico and found out they were out of that my wife then ordered the prime rib and to her dismay that was not available either","so she settled for the salmon and i got the filet","on firebirds you are a steak house and on a monday night no steak","well not a selection","always spectacular","food service and decent prices for a upscale casual steak house ","i get a steak every time less once or twice having pasta or a burger at lunch","steak is the way to do it","decent whiskey prices so wl sometimes go well before our reservation to sit at the well appointed and easy on the eyes bar","very good food the only problem i had at this location was the service","the server left for almost 20 minutes after we asked for a second to look at the menu","we also did get a refill on our drinks until almost 30 minutes after being empty","even then it was the server who helped but someone who wandered past","i probably would come back to this specific location they seemed overwhelmed","the only good thing about this place were drink prices","the drinks themselves could be served better","now not one to be a drink sob when you wanna get a good buzz on then serve is however you can","but when you ask for a jager bomb or an irish car bomb then i think their respective shots should drop bomb into the drink","in theory that would happen if the shot was in","say","a shot glass","they served the shot is a plastic medicine cup","that makes it difficult to drink bomb enjoy","the shot was just floating in the pint glass","does anyone remember exxon valdez","plastic is made of oil and oil floats","also one more thing","the music is so damn loud that i ca hear myself think about how loud the music is","i understand","it tries to be classy what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels like a posh nyc night club","but this is a bowling

time by going to another one of the zaxb locations on the other ends of greenville","sorry does cut it","i do not recommend paying for such service from this location","fun place and the workers are very friendly","but i too expensive during the day and they do not validate","an afternoon outing turned into a 100 affair","this is a bowling alley in epicenter uptown it can be fun but the alleys

reputation of the franchise","the only positive comment i can make is that they are consistent consistently horrible","the product i have been handed has probably matched my actual order 10 of the time that is the odds of the employees doing their jobs correctly is 1 in 10","knowing this do not be surprised if you are handed mcdonalds","i will never return to this location and i suggest others

drinks","food is good though","i came to this location once before with friends and had a good time","i really liked the food","so on valentin day i decided to come again with my family","the food was good","but the overall experience was unacceptable","first of all there was a lot of customers","there were maybe 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied","the waitress acted as if she did want her job","i had to remind her 3 times that i wanted lemon with my water","we ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay","i mean come on","i water and tea","any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty","the waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down","she did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was ok","it seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary","any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers","this lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay","she then made a sorry attempt to make small

came out quickly and smoking hot","the only downside is that it is closer to my house","will definitely be stopping in when we in the area","seemed like the people who go here make it out to be more then what it is","basically i trying to be upscale with their ambiance and prices","i just the food quality and portion size tha not at that level","came here since i saw good reviews and because it was close to southpark mall","however i definitely feel there are way better spots in clt then this","personally would stop by again when visiting clt","their stuffed roosters on the wall are pretty cool though haha vhd","this is an excellent american pub with a unique menu that often puts a twist on some traditional american food","i am particularly fond of the bacon wrapped meatloaf and is the best i have ever had as it was properly cooked","they have a large selection of beer and drinks","note that this place is often busy and seating can be difficult for parties larger than four

restaurant","the smoked wings are the best as well as the macaroni and cheese and the succotash","for dessert i always get coconut cake","the manager of this restaurant is the best","i assure you if you have any issues go to him first and he will fix it","tha all i can ask out of a restaurant","was a great atmosphere at first","then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost","after not checking if the keys were turned in and initially saying no he began to respond with things like i not my f ing responsibility if you lost your keys i do have your keys you f ing stupid b ch and stop giving me attitude about your keys when she clearly was ","i was standing right next to her and after repeated comments like this heard enough and said hey man the girl lost her keys and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here what is your problem","he immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me what the f k are you going to do about it","something i do think was necessary at all at this point ","he proceeds to call over security who says hey le talk about this over here pointing to a spot away from the bar ","i agreed saying yes le talk about it after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt by an overly aggressive bar tender ","security proceeds to push me out a side door without saying a word","if this is the kind of bar you would like to go to then i highly recommend it","excellent chicken go here for the bbq chicken and split the

customer","big applause to the hostess who did a fantastic job greeting customers running food bussing tables and trying to smooth over guests","a large thank you to the one server not named ashleigh who stepped in and took care of us and not too thrilled customers around us","food was defiantly on point especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen","that did a lot","our personal server was rude and i understand it was busy i work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother","if it was for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster","would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship","i love this place","the food was fresh hot and tasty","my waitress was very helpful and she wasted no time getting our orders and bringing out food","my boyfriend and i was on the way to the time warner arena for a basketball and

perfect","drinks are tasty and strong lately bar tender gets 5 stars too","flatbread pizza was nothing short of delicious","service was great and so were the drinks","overall a great place","so disappointed","went to enjoy a nice dinner with my family","when i went to start eating i notice chocolate was lefted on my folk","i called over the supervisor and she did apologize and state that she

something like this happen","definitely not returning","not too great","place is slow and treatment was bad","i had my order last as opposed to everyone else","the people are just plain lazy and stupid","they asked do you want drink","i thought that was obvious","cheese dip was too hot and too much seasoning","second time i ordered cheese dip hair was in it","almost refused to pay","food is ok but sanitation is an issue","i will not come here again","thank you and goodnight","p","s they are very sloppy","to be quite honest service is poor","e attented this resturant few times","at first they treated me as a costumer should be treated","it was until later that i was treated very poorly","maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior e incounter is unacceptable","i would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out","i was patient until i realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress","as a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking","but of course thats just me second when my family i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the kitchen was close and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half before closing time but even then that did much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it was until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me ","they refuse to serve my family i but served them no questions asked","i think not ","an apologe was not even giving to us","thirdly the dj is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song","i as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an

yoe drinking a liter or more make sure yoe not driving","pretzel bread there is none better","also much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in charlotte for both food and beer","most of

disappointed","the food if very good the selection of beer is great and the staff has fun while providing friendly attentive service","definitely recommend it","we went for restaurant week","i was impressed that they offered 3 courses and a drink including some beers wines for the 30 price when most places offering drinks charged 35","their regular prices are not out of line with their food quality and portions","average dinner entr e seems to be 17","my salmon was perfectly done most evenly cooked ever had at a restaurant","the almond rice was fantastic in the reisling sauce from the salmon","the wurstplatte was as expected and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different","the heisse liebe desert vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce peach schnapps topped with homemade whipped cream was incredibly flavorful while the apfelstrudel was understated but better than many","sandwich was pitiful but this place is mostly setup for just pizza","good place for kids

ribs were a bust rarely do i ever say that on any review ","my brother ordered the hot mess burger","from his reaction they should leave that off the menu","it was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich","my mother ordered the smoked salmon","cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred","i concur","finally i ordered the select 4 combo","my review on food is above","my quarrel is the portion size","for 34 i expected","more","again maybe i am hard on the portion cause i wanted more brisket or cause i wanted to make a sandwich

here","the gelato place va da vie gelato is amazing","the ace hardware store is the best e ever been to","great updated plaza with more new stuff opening what seems like every month","do not miss the backlot of the plaza as there are great spots for food or just to hangout with friends","stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament","my biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside which i told them about several times and the laundry cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived after 6pm ","in general they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff","but our room was clean so that is good","this is your typical hyatt place so if you are familiar with the brand and layout you know what to expect","the lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful","this hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators which are in the hallways right behind the front desk also used for access to from the lobby and other rooms ","this was definitely a problem during high traffic times you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators","very poor layout in my opinion","otherwise the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a hyatt place so if you like the layout it will be the same","i really like the sitting area i quite large and has a big l shaped sofa and a separate desk","really nice","the only thing i do like about these rooms is the open bathroom area","the sink is basically in the bedroom so i very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready like brushing your teeth without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping","but if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the

quality interior and very nice touchs to it","i think that this place has potential but i think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out

son for our 5th anniversary on july 2","having just returned from vacation in the outer banks i was skeptical of an inland seafood restaurant but we were pleasantly surprised","the blackened swordfish special was exceptional even better than the similar special i enjoyed only a week earlier in nags head","my wife had the shrimp pasta and loved it as well","to top off the excellent food we had great service including the struggles that come from eating out with a toddler","the only thing i can nit pick is that the seating was uncomfortable to me but i was thinking much about that as i enjoyed my meal","thanks for a great experience for our anniversary","outstanding quality of fresh well prepared food with a price that is quite reasonable given the ambiance and menu","a lovely surprise was that i could enjoy a glass of good wine at a much more reasonable price than i expected","good marketing fish market","that and the food already has me coming back","very disappointed and will never return","i bragged about this restaurant to visiting out of state family because of a past experience","the shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall","we ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash","the server argued and said the chef said it had lobster","fyi my family is from maine and knew there was no lobster","the crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought","when we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served

visit","1 of 5 stars pending review my husband and i ate here on jan 1 2016 and the food was awful","i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens","the grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges","if that was bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate","it was so overbearing i could taste the potatoes or the collards","i called the waitress over and told her i could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that i wanted and i said no just take it off the bill","now since this restaurant is listed as an upscale restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was","well i guess not as no one came so i guess they do really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket","we also had a cup which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp lobster bisque and there was a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty","we paid the bill but since they do seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again","on the way

dinner with friends and family and our server daishai is super awesome","she certainly knows how to efficiently handle a table of 9 ppl","the food was prepared perfectly n the service was great","this would be a three star review but the service just pushes it up to four when it comes to the standard casual american dining this is fighting with chedda for the best spot in the university area and harle is far more accessible","the foo good especially for the price","e had some inconsistencies though a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy a couple of steaks that have been too well done for the medium rare i normally order","i wish there were more appetizing healthy options the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted and most of the best savory foods they

higher price but well worth it","everything was great","from the crispy calamari to the shrimp spicy miso soup","we got the spicy udon noodles with veggies and a couple rolls the exotic and a sweet potato caterpillar do forget the eel sauce and ginger dressing on the side","finished it off with a banana foster and green tea ice cream yumm ","this is one of my favorite places to go when i do go out to eat","they have a wide selection","the strawberry lemonade and the cotton candy shirley temples are my favorite drink","i then get steak bacon smashed potatoes and a side caesar salad","my family and friends have gotten lots of others things and really enjoyed them","i give this a 5 star review is because of the exceptional service i received by my waiter douglas","he was very prompt proactive and polite","initially i was irritated because my boyfriend and i have been served for awhile after being seated","doug came to check on us and served us for the rest of the evening","the

pike s soda shop for you","most of the people writing that this place is an authentic soda shop or retro have lived through the 1940 s or 50 s to know what a real soda shop looks like that is checkered marble floors plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors","pikes is none of that","i a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar","so in that regard haven driven thirty minutes to get there we were disappointed","in terms of the food i ordered what was labeled meatloaf on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top","i added a side of mac and cheese and didn t care for that either as there were bread crumbs baked in","my father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad","you of thought they d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place","he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was just fair ","when dinner was over i handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that i d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out","while we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way i said sure and then i asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave","he looks at me right in the face two feet away and says what are you talking about","i said we ve been trying to settle up and can t because you can t process cards","this momo just kept staring at me until we basically got up and i told him to blank the hell off","what a dumbblank anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and

celebrate and seemed like that they were doing us a favor by been in there","so we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and i been months","decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there","waiter was rude and quick with his responses he did bring everything we ordered form the the start","we had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like i was bothering him by asking","than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks","when we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last nigh leftovers","i know how hard the waiting staff work and i never have tipping less then 20 ","but today is the first time i left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left 0","00 tip","if you want to eat here throw your money in the trash can out side and eat some grass on the side of the road and yol have better

actually like this restaurant however after one experience this has all changed","the food is ok and the servers are less than thrilled with life","needless to say nothing is consistent at this place

and people are nice","recommend the 3 meat nachos","i get that every time","i called around 9 15 on a saturday night to be told that they were closed by one of the female employees who seems as though she cannot understand what i am saying","i honestly do feel she cares about customers and why if the restaurant was closed did i hear things in the back ground","it should be advertised that this place closes at 10 00 when that is not in fact true","i like their salsa verde but honestly the service is not that great and 2 3 times my order is wrong","love steak night on thursday that is better

i could leave my name and number encase anyone seen her","so we drove on with broken hearts","well to my delight at midnight i received a phone call from the night manager saying they found our puppy needless to say we rushed 3 hours back to retrieve our little puppy","to me this shows the character of the employees at azteca and going above and beyond","i love p p and have depended on them for years for amazing meals","i was disappointed lately that the chicken marsala and piccata carry outs have very large pieces of meat that are not the way the dish is supposed to be","i have had to slice

was served vertically on a spike without any clear way to approach it","rambling","my general view of the menu is that i focusing too much on being gourmet and not enough on being","well good","another reviewer got it spot on the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas","great and slowly rotating selection of belgian and farmhouse style beers one of the better places for the

knowledgeable","the service was good","i ordered the firecracker roll it was very good but a little on the small side for the price","the sushi place that i usually eat at has much bigger rolls for that price","i would probably eat here again","my very first visit to cheddars was an awful experience","first the seating is horrible we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because cheddars does have enough seating for large parties","i called to make reservations cheddars does do reservations","not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up

her she might be right but he would know normally since he does try the food","then he paraded around to the other staff in an obvious attempt to make a mockery of the situation","my wife left the place feeling angry embarrassed and humiliated","this guy should not be in the business unless as a janitor","food was warm when i got it","turned cold waiting on the chips","ordered spinach dip","then i ordered a monster cookie","came out with melted ice cream burnt cookie and the cookie was cold","claimed the ice cream was melted because the cookie was hot","laughable","terrible

ordered","gabrielle was an excellent server","she was professional engaging polite and very attentive","me and my wife have been dining for years and never had a more pleasant experience","gabrielle is a great asset to loga roadhouse","we could not have asked for a better experience","definitely a 5 star experience","thanks gabby","not a good place","the sushi was fine but when my guest and i tried to return the hibachi scallops we both purchased the manager came out guns blazing and charged us for both meals even though we had taken maybe a bite between us and despite multiple mistakes by

breweries and restaurants would do the same","great buffet and menu fair prices","sushi rolls are meh at best","we order 8 or 9 different rolls","all were just ok ","dull favor all around but well prepared","ima guess that either their food supplier is the best or they are trying to cut costs","i will not be coming back as there are many better sushi places in charlotte that are the same price or cheaper","on another note the atmosphere and the scenery is top notch here","restaurant itself was terribly hot service sucks menu is okay and tha being generous","we waited an hour to get our food and one of our pizzas was even cut up for us","they delivered our appetizer to the wrong table and we had to wait for them to remake it","no one came to check on us so i found napkins and boxes

hot and ready pizza as quickly as one would expect at this location","they tend to be really busy and i have had to wait a while or i just leave because there are so many people in a small space","i would suggest calling your order in ahead of time so you can get in and out more quickly","tha what i will do in the future","waited over an hour for our food","our waitress never checked in on us mentioned being short staffed or that there would be a long delay","when our food came it was only part of our order","she said they did have homemade chips so they could substitute fries","but then told us they did have time to run to the store to get potatoes so we did get any sides","terrible service and experience","just not good at all","waited 45 min for an appetizer and the manager rolled his eyes when we wanted it taken off","the host food runner had absolutely no idea what he was doing","constantly running food to the wrong table and was very awkward","i do feel bad because it seems like he was just given the job without any training whatsoever","the trivia questions on trivia night were laughable","if you want to go somewhere that hosts are you smarter than a 5th grader nights then this is your place","it would not have been so awful if our server was even around","we had 1 beer the whole night because our server was not present to even ask if we wanted another beer or refill on water","food was mediocre at best","good customer service can always make up for lackluster food but this was definitely not the case","bad attitude among entire staff including management

refills","nothing i had to ask her to do things ","she only came to my table about two three times before checking out","i guess the young girls that work in this restaurant feel they need to cater to a specific population but this place is even high end dining to kiss that much a ","in addition the food was nasty and cold not worth my money parking and time","i will never ever return","i love dandelion market","i what tapas is supposed to be","consistently original well made and perfect for sharing","i think e probably had everything at this point and do remember being disappointed","upstairs is a good time afterwards too if for no other reason than to watch them haul that massive table up to the ceiling","from the outside and even at first blush upon walking inside the dandelion market has the feel of an irish british pub which i guess makes sense once you read the blurb on the back of the menu about what the dandelion market was in england","nice relaxed atmosphere","good beer selection with an emphasis on the locals the cocktails we tried were also very good","the food here is tapas style so my wife and i split 5 plates which were all amazing and

get a refill on our drinks until almost 30 minutes after being empty","even then it was the server who helped but someone who wandered past","i probably would come back to this specific location they seemed overwhelmed","this is easily the worst zaxb restaurant location i have ever been to and it certainly damages the reputation of the franchise","the only positive comment i can make is that they are consistent consistently horrible","the product i have been handed has probably matched my actual order 10 of the time that is the odds of the employees doing their jobs correctly is 1 in

decided to give it a try and go get a take out buffet since i was near by","it turned out to be one the worst decisions that i made in my life","first of all i was treated rudely by the front desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there","well i admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places but i still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several spanish speaking dudes who were checking out before me and who were clearly pointing looking and making fun of me","however i would give the place 1 star just for that reason alone","on top of that the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago","i even found a hair in my eggplant and ended up throwing away about half of the food","i

customers","this lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay","she then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us","we were given a review card before leaving","the experience was ok but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone","thanks a lot","my boyfriend and i believe in tipping excellent customer service","well this

two small children maybe more of a date night place","but worth trying no matter what","if you have the misfortune to be seated in the first banquette on the right be prepared to have your enjoyment of your meal continously interrupted by the wait staff banging their water pitchers right behind your head even if you ask the manager to have them quit","that space was never meant for staff use and it needs to be blocked with a nice plant or a piece of plywood over it so customers can enjoy their evening","funny this review would not post until i raised my review from 2 stars to 3","tha one way to look better","out of every single restaurant e been to in charlotte soul gastrolounge has been my favorite for years","my favorite dish would be their pork belly tacos nothing compares","they just

oysters etc","the drinks are phenomenal as well especially their moscow mule","warning though if you plan to come on a friday or saturday night be prepared to wait up to an hour possibly two for a table inside","i will say though i more than worth the wait","we had a very bad experience at this place a year ago but wanted to give it a go one last time but we are disappointed that it happened again at the same location","the waitress is very rude and did bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she did bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed btw we were at pf chan from 8 45 pm and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that i have never seen someone talk to a customer","this was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like pf chan","i would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever","i would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us","by far the best restaurant and bar in charlotte","i have been going to the soul gastrolounge for 3 years and their entire menu is phenominal","the staff is on point and the only downside is that the wait is often 1","5 2 hours or more but that only speaks highly of the restaurant itself","i ordered coconut curry dish when i got it it was dry like the heat in charlotte","i asked them why","they said we only use a curry paste not actually curry","wtf you it says curry meaning it should have curry aka gravy","this place make no sense the manager or the staff does know anything wha going on","the staff has a damn attitude yoe in the damn service industry you need to learn how to handle people no matter what the problem is","if you do like dealing with people then go find another job","eclectic fun atmosphere with matching eclectic fun food","the place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters exposed brick walls eclectic light fixtures and a peacock over the sushi bar","it is a bit loud but the dj spun music is good","the food is a great collection of modern interpretations of regional classics in small plates to share","there are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine but i did have enough room to sample ","with all of this there are also simple kebab options and dip options","then ther the sushi bar and menu","yes eclectic","but tasty and done well","coctails are good wine list is good and the beer list seemed a bit short but with more than enough liquors to make up for it","probably the best bourbon list e seen since we left kentucky","first time patron here and im hooked","we were able to quickly get a table shortly after opening on a sunday however as we enjoyed round after round of tapas sushi and interesting cocktails the bar area filled up with people waiting to be seated","the food is top notch the serving staff seemed adequate to keep the drinks fresh and finished plates hardly sat idle before being removed","the price may look high however the quality and great menu selections are definitely worth it","best place in charlotte for sushi","i absolutely love this place","i discovered it when my friends came into town because we were craving late night sushi","the bartender h 40 with tattoos was cool and very pleasant to speak to","the drinks he made were definitely on point","highly recommend trying the godzilla roll the yellowtail tuna omg sex in your mouth and the dynamite roll","love the service

were ordering from lunch or dinner menu","i said i wanted the dinner salad","half a chicken breast 3 raw sliced onions some pico cheese dressing and lettuce","all for 9","49","been a long time since i felt this ripped off going out to eat","astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurants unenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring food","while i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasn t busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson","despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver","and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all","too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive and these too were incorrect","i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to prepare","the waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen staff true professionalism","the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologize","despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect","we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree","that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i don t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary","my entree was entirely forgettable indeed a few days later i have no recollection of what it was ","i do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy","the two word review why bother","good atmosphere and the food is good","so after leaving the gym i decide to pick up a sandwich for dinner at subway","turns out they had no white bread left","the most basic type of bread","the only two options were wheat and honey oat","just ridiculous","now e frequented this subway before and have never come across this problem","how are you the sandwich spot and run out of bread","tha like the pizza place running out of pepperoni","unacceptable","we were in charlotte over the weekend and ate here on saturday night","with it being a saturday night and a comic book convention weekend we knew it would be busy","the hostess was very polite","she told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time","once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food at the same time","the server brought our drinks back pretty quickly","another server brought our food out refilled our drinks and got us silverware","our original server passed by when we were almost done eating","he asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously did hear us ask for refills and our check","we had to ask another server for our check","she asked who our server was we did not know his name but did point him out to her","when she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said oh ","i do think i was the first person to have problems with him","he did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks","i left a 10 cash tip and wrote 0 on the bill","the transaction processed through my bank today","the boy who did have time to wait on us added 9 to my bill for a total of a 19 tip which he did not deserve","i tip based on my service","i would never leave no tip even with horrible service","i am very disappointed","i know 9 is not a lot of money to some but again i did not authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill","we have been coming here for years","and every time i have not been disappointed","her the catch though i never get anything else but the baby back ribs with coleslaw and french fries","so to ask me about the rest of the menu is a complete waste of time","with that said the ribs are the best","i can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all","why","well i not because a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite","5 9 150","i because the ribs are so good that i am not even thinking about how full i am","the meat falls off the bone","the sauce is insane","and throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and i am happier than a pig in","do yourself a favor and get the ribs","on a side note my wife last year ordered the catch of the day and she said it was good","now she only gets the ribs","nice servers and a nice looking clean place too","needs new management","used to be a good place to go but

stuffed by the time the desert came","the brownie was warm and very fresh","i will return","place has character and very friendly and professional staff","the only negative thing i could say is about the cleanliness","it does seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest customer even when i not busy","it also does have the sanitary feel to it sanitary grade 96","0 ","i noticed that not all the staff wear gloves hair net hat when handling food","food it self does look taste fresh","i had the noda salad for lunch and it tasted like i been out all day","great location it seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee","however based on my experience i would order anything simply because i would wanna get sick","i kinda like waffle house","if that makes any

email him my video pics so i did just that","he said h refund my total purchase and to date that has happened","i called last week to speak with the owner","she picked up the phone and was too busy working","i asked if there was a better time to call back and she said no","i would think addressing sanitation issues and or consumer concerns complaints would be part of her job duty","officially grossed out and refuse to give this place my business again","visited a number of times in the past few years both in small and larger groups","great breakfast all day items and i love that they have

will never frequent this place went to is order a flat pizza and the idiotic buffoon did not even know what the price of the item was the owner stood in the very back of the restaurant and carried on the conversation while the lobby filled up with customers","poor staffing and time mismanagement equals never ever ever subway at this location again","the toothless lady asks you what you want on your sub before you get in the door","then 20 seconds later shes asks you again because she forgot","say no to drugs","and stay in school","this review relates only to the annual oyster feast","we attended the 3rd annual one on october 2nd 2014","price per head was 95","wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill","the wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor","so that whole aspect was a sales pitch","for 95 done buying","the oyster selection was incredible at least in terms of presentation ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country","by the time you returned to your seat you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same","not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor","other selections were fried oysters over breaded and void of any oyster flavor oysters rockefeller fine enough and a clam crostini too fishy after about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers you realize tha it","there is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it and why would there be i 95 so i m going into it thinking it is a meal ","but they do even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal","overall with the alcohol included it is probably at most a 55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards","manager robert and his staff made our night","our server kareem was fun engaging and attentive","thank you all for your professionalism and making our celebration a success","the toothless lady asks you what you want on your sub before you get in the door","then 20 seconds later shes asks you again because she forgot","say no to drugs","and stay in school","my

go there just to have her make your sub","i swear as long as sh making it you wo be disappointed","very underwhelming","for the price of the mothe day brunch the quality was extremely poor","hash browns were burnt and tasted stale","prime rib was medium rare but still tougher than a 2 steak","oysters you could tell were frozen and were extremely slimy","in the business so i understand the concept of trying to maximize profit but this was just a rip off","40 and 20 for kids i was expecting much much better","we will never return and i would give 0 stars if possible","first time i put a

treated very poorly","maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior e incounter is unacceptable","i would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out","i was patient until i realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress","as a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking","but of course thats just me second when my family i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the kitchen was close and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half before closing time but even then that

fantastic job greeting customers running food bussing tables and trying to smooth over guests","a large thank you to the one server not named ashleigh who stepped in and took care of us and not too thrilled customers around us","food was defiantly on point especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen","that did a lot","our personal server was rude and i understand it was busy i work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother","if it was for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster","would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship","was a great atmosphere at first","then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost","after not checking if the keys were turned in and initially saying no he began to respond with things like i not my f ing responsibility if you lost your keys i do have your keys you f ing stupid b ch and stop giving me attitude about your keys when she clearly was ","i was standing right next to her and after repeated comments like this heard enough and said hey man the girl lost her keys and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here what is your problem","he immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me what the f k are you going to do about it","something i do think was necessary at all at this point ","he proceeds to call over security who says hey le talk about this over here pointing to a spot away from the bar ","i agreed saying yes le talk about it after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt by an overly aggressive bar tender ","security proceeds to push me out a side door without saying a word","if this is the kind of bar you would like to go to then i highly recommend it","this is an excellent american pub with a unique menu that often puts a twist on some traditional american food","i am particularly fond of the bacon wrapped meatloaf and is the best i have ever had as it was properly cooked","they have a large

unbiased opinion","to rate the food it was 4 5","chopped pork brisket and burnt ends were tender cooked to near perfection and delicious","burnt ends are a must","if yoe going for those items yoe in for a treat","st louis ribs were a bust rarely do i ever say that on any review ","my brother ordered the hot mess burger","from his reaction they should leave that off the menu","it was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich","my mother ordered the smoked salmon","cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred","i concur","finally i ordered the select 4 combo","my review on food is above","my quarrel is the portion size","for 34 i expected","more","again maybe i am hard on the portion cause i wanted more brisket or cause i wanted to make

and dairy free friendly","my wife has never gotten sick from accidental gluten contamination and it all my kids love everything on the menu","highly recommended","stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament","my biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside which i told them about several times and the laundry cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived after 6pm ","in general they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff","but our room was clean so that is good","this is your typical hyatt place so if you are familiar with the brand and layout you know what to expect","the lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful","this hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators which are in the hallways right behind the front desk also used for access to from the lobby and other rooms ","this was definitely a problem during high traffic times you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators","very poor layout in my opinion","otherwise the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a hyatt place so if you like the layout it will be the same","i really like the sitting area i quite large and has a big l shaped sofa and a separate desk","really nice","the only thing i do like about these rooms is the open bathroom area","the sink is basically in the bedroom so i very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready like brushing your teeth without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping","but if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time no problem","negatives small lobby and breakfast area cramped if busy overflowing trash cans outside a lot of laundry

television downstairs to lounge and watch","it was a great experience with kind and friendly staff","this hotel has a high quality interior and very nice touchs to it","i think that this place has potential but i think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out and the mini market","the pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to","there was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms","that did not make a difference","the pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do","was a lot to do","fun for the kids for sure","packages made it a decent deal but games cost more than average and the staff is helpful for the most part","main complaint i have is that they advertise a 30 min laser tag session and the kids only were in there for about 20 minutes","first i would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job","lucy is an angel","it meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea","i know grandma can do it herself but we encourage her to let us help her","for anyone that looks after someone who has needs the little things mean the world to people who take care of them","from the bottom of my heart thank you","however hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people","it is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people especially at night as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped","bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location","there was some confusion or miscommunication about the room i had booked","i booked a two bed room and what i received was a one bed room with a pull out couch","the other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed","truth be told i was not stoked to sleep on the floor on friday for 140 a night","however we were able to move rooms on saturday","hyatt","spend the money and supply your staff team","hotel polic are a hit and miss ","what i mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay but be charged for it another time","there is apparently a 30 damage fee to cover any hotel property if ruined","i was not charged this fee before so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill","however the kind desk manager joel was able to remove it","this is my second time at this hotel and both times i had my dog","the first time i was not charged 75 even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file ","for the record the dog is well behaved","when i asked the manager name","about it he simply told me that it was policy","i told the manager i understood but if there if a policy follow through with it at all times","he removed it but honestly the money did matter","it is more important that i can be informed","i was frustrated","i felt like i was being dismissed from the conversation by having the charge dropped","i want to be informed so i am prepared for the charge on my bill","bottom line if you have a policy follow through with it at all times","inconsistency kills a business","i do not like to be surprised with fees i was not informed of nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel","i do get to see my family as often as i like since i took a job in florida so these trips are special to us","i chose hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has

breaking down","at one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well","we probably wo come back to sports connection next time for our group bowling","the staff was great","but the lanes need some serious tlc","when yoe paying per hour i frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed","again great staff","just poor machinery on the lanes","brought the kids and all i can say is they had a blast","from the giant bounce houses to the arcade with games for all ages and to the bowling both full size and mini bowling it could have been have been a better place to get the kids all worn out while having a good time","we will definitely be back","friendly staff","although the meeting room was set up according to our provided diagram wendy was great about setting up the additional tables and extras we required","aaron was helpful as well","sleep room was nice","refrigerator in room along with a separate living area","not very appetizing","worst staff imaginable","just a bunch of rude teenagers that want to take your money and could care less about you having an enjoyable experience","no

esp","brats is amazing","games are awesome outside","easy access with new parking garage","love this place","very cool venue they have board games cornhole giant connect four volleyball and more","and the food is delicious i recommend the honey bbq chicken nachos but everything is good ","not a beer connoisseur my any means but i always enjoy drinks from here","great place to hang out with friends especially when the weather is nice","food was excellent however it came out barely warm","i believe it was because the server was not particularly attentive to me given that i asked specifically for

frien night or our too take the family and the staff is amazing","the service has improved considerably since the last time i was here","maybe just due to the server i had patrick who was probably one

cashier to tell her our order when our food came out she did bring out the fries we had ordered which you have to pay 1","99 extra for we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we were getting them","we started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way the plantains were cooked either and the rice was cold","it was almost closing time so another customer

family because of a past experience","the shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall","we ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash","the server argued and said the chef said it had lobster","fyi my family is from maine and knew there was no lobster","the crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought","when we questioned the server as to

anything","not to mention we had planned a birthday surprise dropping off cake and candles before dinner","the waitress literally came out and asked the entire table should i put the candles in the

dinner","great wine selection and knowledgeable staff","great night out with husband","food was great","1 of 5 stars pending review my husband and i ate here on jan 1 2016 and the food was awful","i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens","the grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges","if that was bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate","it was so overbearing i could taste the potatoes or the collards","i called the waitress over and told her i could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that i wanted and i said no just take it off the bill","now since this restaurant is listed as an upscale restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was","well i guess not as no one came so i guess they do really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket","we also had a cup which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp lobster bisque and there was a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty","we paid the bill but since they do seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again","on the way home i was reading their reviews and wished that i had done that before going as there were many bad reviews","visited january

charlotte","i spent many nights drinking shots and delicious concoctions in this place","it always reminded me of new york pubs especially in the winter ","the food was always top notch and the best

barclay the cajun queen catherin fenwic the laurel market hotel charlotte red rocks open kitchen and the list goes on","toda special of carrot cake was served cold did seem fresh at all","strawberry milkshake tasted artificial as if were made with syrup instead of real strawberry ice cream too sweet and not quite the right texture","coke float was pretty good but i pretty hard to mess that up","service was quick and friendly and ambiance was right on for a old fashion soda shop","food was great","only complaint is that when i asked about a kids menu i was told we have a kids cheeseburger and grilled cheese got the kids cheeseburger","9","50","i asked about this when i saw it on the bill and was told we do really have a kids menu","e only been once","the food is okay but nothing to write home about","i like the concept of the homemade sodas but it is something i want all the time","would be 4 stars but my service was pretty lackluster the time that i went","great place for lunch dinner or a night out","try some pineapple rum or even ff in rum","yes quite crazy","this place has gone down hill for sure","ate there today with my boys took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we placed our orders","it was busy","my so kids meal came out with no fries","asked the guy who brought it to us for fries and he seemed annoyed","needless to say i wo return","oh and i

existing","so i used to actually like this restaurant however after one experience this has all changed","the food is ok and the servers are less than thrilled with life","needless to say nothing is consistent at this place and it is unfortunate because a movie helped guarantee its success so wha the excuse","if you want a quick place to eat with mediocre food and service by all means try this place out","much has been written about pik old fashioned soda shop in local print and web publication so we as a family decided to give it a try over fathe day weekend","now let me personally review pike s soda shop for you","most of the people writing that this place is an authentic soda shop or retro have lived through the 1940 s or 50 s to know what a real soda shop looks like that is checkered marble floors plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors","pikes is none of that","i a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar","so in that regard haven driven thirty minutes to get there we were disappointed","in terms of the food i ordered what was labeled meatloaf on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top","i added a side of mac and cheese and didn t care for that either as there were bread crumbs baked in","my father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad","you of thought they d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place","he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was just fair ","when dinner was over i handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that i d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out","while we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way i said sure and then i asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave","he looks at me right in the face two feet away and says what are you talking about","i said we ve been trying to settle up and can t because you can t process cards","this momo just kept staring at me until we basically got up and i told him to blank the hell off","what a dumbblank anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave","the service as far as drink refills and delivering meals was at the 5 to 10 tip level and no more","1 out of 5 stars ","not food related but character this past weekend my wife and i where traveling from michigan to florida we stopped at the plaza where azteca is located to decided where to spend the night","as we where leaving my little puppy opened the rear window and jumped out and ran away my wife and i searched for over 24 hours to no avail we had to continue on due to having to return to work","i stopped into azteca and asked if i could leave my name and number encase anyone seen her","so we drove on with broken hearts","well to my delight at midnight i received a phone call from the night manager saying they found our puppy needless to say we rushed 3 hours back to retrieve our little puppy","to me this shows the character of the employees at azteca and going above and beyond","love the decor friendly staff good variety on tap food is fantastic","good wings","the what it is is well on its own planet","the honey chicken pasta is solid","and the bread pudding is amazing","will be back","love the atmosphere this place is great in terms of service it really surprised us as we werent sure what to expect","the food is great but holy smokes the beer selection is really solid too","really laid back place","we will be back for sure","great beer and atmosphere","i was here for the monday run club","service to get a beer was slow","go check out this place for yourselves","great staff and they know how to make one hell of a sandwich","i went here with my family around 2pm memorial day weekend","there were a total of 7 in my party including my older parents","we asked for a place to sit outside with some shade","i was told by the blond hostess she could not accommodate a large party outside in the shade","she offered us a table inside or suggested we wait until it became cloudy","i had to ask","when did she think it would be cloudy","lol","anyways i told her no thank you i will come back when i cloudy","i was not impressed","now after reading some of these reviews i am happy we went elsewhere","my suggestion to groups of more than two","go elsewhere","awesome food and service","went to restaurant week and i had ny strip wife had filet mignon both were outstanding","mine was rare to perfection","decent beer selection but cocktails are superb","food is very good and they have a sunday brunch buffet that is very good","it will cost you 19","95 and i would say i worth it","on the buffet you will find scrambled eggs grits sausage bacon honey baked ham steak home fries sweet potato fries donuts salami pepperoni cheese assortment pastry assortment flatbread pizza assortment waffles biscuits and gravy mussels and your choice of an a la carte menu item","guacamole made table side is good as it should be since it is made table side","duh","the chairs are carved wood and not very comfortable","staff is ok","overall the food is safe and nothing to write home about","worst mexican food e ever eaten so bland and flavorless","dried out chicken what a waste of 30","food was not good and service was poor at best","my wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it","the waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay","she replied that it was to her liking that it was very dry bland and not very good at all","the waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes","he removed the dish from the table","he did even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal","we will never eat at this restaurant ever again","my advice would be to look elsewhere for mexican food","ther much friendly and delicious mexican restaurants out there","the food is amazing the service is even better my wif birthday and the whole restaurant knew it and she was just so happy","our server george was just great","the entire establishment is

fine dinning experience e had in charlotte","other fine restaurants i","e","rut chris sulliva do even compare","best steak ever","best appetizers lobster mac cheese is baked heaven","great staff and atmosphere","if you want to treat yourself to the best go to the capital grille","i got food poisoning from the meatball sandwich","not very happy about this","could even eat but half the sandwich something did taste right","well thank goodness i did eat more","such a bad service sloppy sandwichs my family owns subway and i know how a sandwich is made then she has the right mind to argue with me","never go here again","subpar","everything food service atmosphere subpar","good food but mediocre service","broken ice machine and too loud music playing","not the best experience e had at a chil","nobody comes to seat you","there is almost always food or trash all over the floors","they had to redo orders for 3 other tables while we were in there and our food was made properly either","they take forever to get you your food and then it will probably be wrong","take your money elsewhere unless you enjoy chil food so much you can ignore the other things","just an overall bad experience going to this place","this is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached not a brewery","if yoe trying to eat here on a budget","do","tha the best advice i suppose","aim away from peak hours for better service and i personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles especially for the price not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up fried chicken but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing and the waffle was nothing special","to make matters worse it was served vertically on a spike without any clear way to approach it","rambling","my general view of the menu is that i focusing too much on being gourmet and not enough on being","well good","another reviewer got it spot on the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas","great and slowly rotating selection of belgian and farmhouse style beers one of the better places for the style in charlotte if tha what yoe into which is what earns it the third star but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd tha used to the cit higher end dining and nightlife","if yoe got money to burn on food or mixed drinks or yoe just here for the beer you could do worse than a night at heist","it would let me give it 0 stars","it was absolutely horrible","minutes of waiting to be seated from a young woman who obviously did not want us there and the couple before us","waited 10 min before we walked out before we ordered","it was not busy at all","the whole staff was annoyed and not there to do their job","whooooooo so glad to walk across the street to tgfridays it was awesome over there","food was warm when i got it","turned cold waiting on the chips","ordered spinach dip","then i ordered a monster cookie","came out with melted ice cream burnt cookie and the cookie was cold","claimed the ice cream was melted because the cookie was hot","laughable","terrible experience at a good restaurant in general","good sandwiches and soups in a casual cozy environment","they have several bread types amongst them a baguette like tasty although chewy","black bean soup and tomato are excellent","back area usually unkempt and needs sweeping from 1p close but bathroom is cleaner than some other locations","cashiers are friendly well trained","menu is the same as other paneras creative health conscious food choices","mistakenly placed my pickup order at the wrong store","spoke with the manager showed my proof of payment and a new order was quickly made for me","she totally fixed my screw up","this is my second review ","horrible ","horrible","worst experience ever ","nobody told me to sit here ","almost empty and nobody sits me down","asked for sharly temple and they said they do have it ","i got it yesterday wth","rarely disappointed here","the only thing that bummed me was that i did get a dessert treat reward for my birthday like i usually do","however the drink reward was a very refreshing treat at the right time for me","nice atmosphere good food lots of plugins to do work","good for business meetings or a good quick meal","they have those ziosk so one would think i got my table and i can order right no wrong you sit there 15 minutes before the waiter can enable it or take the order themselves and waste our time","the service was good","i ordered the firecracker roll it was very good but a little on the small side for the price","the sushi place that i usually eat at has much bigger rolls for that price","i would probably eat here again","was ok ","no place is prefect","it is what it is","enjoyed myself quality time with my oldest boy","not a good place","the sushi was fine but when my guest and i tried to return the hibachi scallops we both purchased the manager came out guns blazing and charged us for both meals even though we had taken maybe a bite between us and despite multiple mistakes by the server and the manager we still were charged full price for something that was subpar and untouched","i do not recommend this restaurant","i will go back for the simple fact that it was clean and a wonderful atmosphere","but i was not all that impressed with the food","it seemed to be you basic asian hibachi food served differently","i was expecting more fusion ","but perhaps its just what i ordered","yes yes yes yes yes","the amount of food for the price and the food taste great","that broccoli and cheese casserole is devine and the carrots are carmelized to perfection","my very first visit to cheddars was an awful experience","first the seating is horrible we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because cheddars does have enough seating for large parties","i called to make reservations cheddars does do reservations","not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different sections is oblivious","sure this location loses out on a lot of money behind this very reason","do better cheddars","i will never bring my family to this place again","greeters at the door are horrible at customer service","i have been here twice in the the time frame of 3 weeks","each time it has been several disagreements between staff members at the hostess stand","very unprofessional","they seem as if thee not here to work and provide great customer service","this needs to be taken care of immediately","i love the restaurant and have visited other locations for cheddars but this is by far the worst","i love this place","the food is always great and the good part","its affordable","i would give it 5 stars but

the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down","she did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was ok","it seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary","any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers","this lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay","she then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us","we were given a review card before leaving","the experience was ok but we would most likely

delicious cheap and the nighttime service is beyond awful","i witnessed several parties walk in that were seated until 10 minutes after","there was a group of young men who were seated that did have a

staff","none of the employees were valued therefore no one saw value in their job","as a waitress you get paid 2","13 hourly","the tips were okay but it just did seem worth it when your managers do schedule a person to do dishes shakes etc","all night and expect you to work overtime with out being paid","i go to college for a reason and i so i never have to work in an environment like this just terrible","stopped in to get a quick dinner","i will say like many other bars in charlotte it has over priced food with poor service","i felt because i am not a regular they just sort of ignored me","i ordered my burger med rare","at first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes","i just moved them aside and started to eat my burger","after the first bite i could tell it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done","all i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it","all and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut ed spinach was good","my daughter and i arrived at 2 34 and the teenager host look at us weird and said we close soon","i said we know yoe still open for 1 2 an hour no","he started stuttering and a woman who i assume to be the owner asks the host is there a problem","she did give him a chance to answer back cut

had to ask 3 times for them to clean but it was only grudgingly","our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum","for some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3 straw thin french fries it was not worth the time nor the money","putting up with it due to the inclement weather we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house","this of course infuriated us more","how a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me","it is good breakfast food they can ease up on the butters and oils a bit their veggie scramble is good and of course their applebutter with their buiscuit is jummy","dark and cozy bar with nice porch and beachy vibe","great wings","i had the gold rush wings were just as described sweet and spicy","cheese fries could be better","servers were nice and as a party of 16 we kept them running","while the wait was long because there was only one waitress serving the entire restraunt the service was excellent because the server kept a good attitude even while being swamped with

time but we are disappointed that it happened again at the same location","the waitress is very rude and did bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she did bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed btw we were at pf chan from 8 45 pm and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that i have never seen someone talk to a customer","this was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like pf chan","i would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever","i would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us","what can i say","i a subway","a sandwich good fast cheap","just looked at my receipt and saw i was charged 8","25 tax when it should be 1 less","best chicken salad i have had in a long time","love the atmosphere but my husband and i were sat at a

the place love the atmosphere and music","amazing waitresses very funny and attentive","great food definitely with a little twist","many options to try out","i recommend this location though it was hot while we were there","wonderful","i had low expectations of finding authentic chinese food at this chain but was nonetheless disappointed that the lemongrass chicken salad hardly had any chicken and the dressing was more lemon than was lemongrass the asparagus was seriously undercooked the garlic noodles were barely garlicky and the berry ginger shortcake had no ginger","however the fiery wontons were good though pricey at 7 for 6 and our server moua was great","go for the ambiance but not if you actually want any asian flavors","so after leaving the gym i decide to pick up a sandwich for dinner at subway","turns out they had no white bread left","the most basic type of bread","the only two options were wheat and honey oat","just ridiculous","now e frequented this subway before and

the best dishes i ever tasted i get it every time","highly recommend it","stopped in after reading the reviews","great appetizer menu","oysters were perfectly cooked pepper jelly was awesome and the fried green tomatoes were the best e ever had","the rest of the menu was disappointing unless yoe in the mood for burgers fries and homestyle","last but not least the dessert menu","get the cake","worth the price","if you have the misfortune to be seated in the first banquette on the right be prepared to have your enjoyment of your meal continously interrupted by the wait staff banging their water pitchers right behind your head even if you ask the manager to have them quit","that space was never meant for staff use and it needs to be blocked with a nice plant or a piece of plywood over it so customers can enjoy their evening","funny this review would not post until i raised my review from 2 stars to 3","tha one way to look better","i ordered coconut curry dish when i got it it was dry like the heat in charlotte","i asked them why","they said we only use a curry paste not actually curry","wtf you it says curry meaning it should have curry aka gravy","this place make no sense

people","also very good attention to cleanliness","will eat here again","needs new management","used to be a good place to go but terrible service the last 3 times e gone","they also brought me my check before i was ready to leave","oh well","came here initially for the lobster mac and cheese it was probably the only thing i enjoyed here","beware prices are expensive even for lunch","i had a burger and was impressed with it at all the cocktails were anything special and for 10 i would choose beer next time","located in downtown charlotte","this was the meetup location for the enlightened at the ingress abaddon anomaly","it is centrally located","i am a huge panera loyalist so this review is hard to write","this location as well as the location in cmc levine hospital down the street

trace of my order","i showed them the confirmation still up on my phone screen and was told the make it right then and there","fine","i go to the front order breakfast for my mom as well come back 5 minutes later and told we out of that souffl ","il be about 20 minutes for the next batch","i have to be to work in 20 minutes","nothing rapid about this here","then i was told they have a four cheese

i had wanted a breakfast sandwich i would have ordered one","the manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund","this is the second time e had an issue with this location","i wo return but i suggest you fix it soon panera","feels like every other panera","food tastes fresh not too expensive","astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurants unenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring food","while i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasn t busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson","despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver","and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all","too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive and these too were incorrect","i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to prepare","the waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen staff true professionalism","the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologize","despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect","we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree","that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i don t know if it was a mistake or intentionally

it","there is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it and why would there be i 95 so i m going into it thinking it is a meal

things like i not my f ing responsibility if you lost your keys i do have your keys you f ing stupid b ch and stop giving me attitude about your keys when she clearly was ","i was standing right next to her and after repeated comments like this heard enough and said hey man the girl lost her keys and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here what is your problem","he immediately

are very sloppy","to be quite honest service is poor","e attented this resturant few times","at first they treated me as a costumer should be treated","it was until later that i was treated very poorly","maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior e incounter is unacceptable","i would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out","i was patient until i realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress","as a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking","but of course thats just me second when my family i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the kitchen was close and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half before closing time but even then that did much bother us i

mother ordered the smoked salmon","cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred","i concur","finally i ordered the select 4 combo","my review on food is above","my quarrel is the

beautiful","prices are fair","stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament","my biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside which i told them about several times and the laundry cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived after 6pm ","in general they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff","but our room was clean so that is good","this is your typical hyatt place so if you are familiar with the brand and layout you know what to expect","the lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful","this hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators which are in the hallways right behind the front desk also used for access to from the lobby and other rooms ","this was definitely a problem during high traffic times you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators","very poor layout in my opinion","otherwise the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a hyatt place so if you like the layout it will be the same","i really like the sitting area i quite large and has a big l shaped sofa and a separate desk","really nice","the only thing i do like about these rooms is the open bathroom area","the sink is basically in the bedroom so i very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready like brushing your teeth without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping","but if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time no problem","negatives small lobby and breakfast area cramped if busy overflowing trash cans outside a lot of laundry cleaning carts in hallways very cramped elevator location","positives large rooms new modern room was clean and quiet","we brought a group of 18 in this past weekend","it was a fun time and the logistics of it all went smooth but the lanes kept breaking down","at one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well","we probably wo come back to sports connection next time for our group bowling","the staff was great","but the lanes need some serious tlc","when yoe paying per hour i frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed","again great staff","just poor machinery on the lanes","this hotel has a high quality interior and very nice touchs to it","i think that this place has potential but i think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out and the mini market","the pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to","there was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms","that did not make a difference","the pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do","first i would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job","lucy is an angel","it meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea","i know grandma can do it herself but we encourage her to let us help her","for anyone that looks after someone who has needs the little things mean the world to people who take care of them","from the bottom of my heart thank you","however hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people","it is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people especially at night as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped","bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location","there was some confusion or miscommunication about the room i had booked","i booked a two bed room and what i received was a one bed room with a pull out couch","the other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed","truth be told i was not stoked to sleep on the floor on friday for 140 a night","however we were able to move rooms on saturday","hyatt","spend the money and supply your staff team","hotel polic are a hit and miss ","what i mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay but be charged for it another time","there is apparently a 30 damage fee to cover any hotel property if ruined","i was not charged this fee before so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill","however the kind desk manager joel was able to remove it","this is my second time at this hotel and both times i had my dog","the first time i was not charged 75 even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file ","for the record the dog is well behaved","when i asked the manager name","about it he simply told me that it was policy","i told the manager i understood but if there if a policy follow through with it at all times","he removed it but honestly the money did matter","it is more important that i can be informed","i was frustrated","i felt like i was being dismissed from the conversation by having the charge dropped","i want to be informed so i am prepared for the charge on my bill","bottom line if you have a policy follow through with it at all times","inconsistency kills a business","i do not like to be surprised with fees i was not informed of nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel","i do get to see my family as often as i like since i took a job in florida so these trips are special to us","i chose hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends","i

are super nice and they have an amazing selection of local beers","the ice at the end of the table is cool and the food is solid","plenty to do and good vibes","brought the kids and all i can say is they had a blast","from the giant bounce houses to the arcade with games for all ages and to the bowling both full size and mini bowling it could have been have been a better place to get the kids all worn out while having a good time","we will definitely be back","was a lot to do","fun for the kids for sure","packages made it a decent deal but games cost more than average and the staff is helpful for the most part","main complaint i have is that they advertise a 30 min laser tag session and the kids only were in there for about 20 minutes","not very appetizing","favorite place to have a beer and their food is surprisingly wonderful","amazing grilled wings","lots of fun indoors and out","great family atmosphere","worst staff imaginable","just a bunch of rude teenagers that want to take

the cesar pizza","awesome","now i just have lettuce on top of pizza that i paid 20 for","great place for a frien night or our too take the family and the staff is amazing","the pizzas and appetizers especially the pretzels with beer cheese are excellent","thee toppings always seem fresh","my wife and i always make our own pizza so i ca attest to their house pizzas","the only negative is the

kinky hair on your plate to get free food","food was excellent however it came out barely warm","i believe it was because the server was not particularly attentive to me given that i asked

staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests","there was not one time during the evening that kay came to greet my husband and i","at the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out","because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional 400 until the next day","we called and emailed kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again","fortunately the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our

skates who ran over my wifes foot","my wife was in regular shoes and not participating in any ice skating activities but was still injured","management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities ","i was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an activity ","this should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas","accidents are very likely to happen during crowded times if this is not mandated","had low expectations after the concierge said he did not like it but the pizza was really good and the staff was friendly","fuel is definitely a knock off new york style pizza joint","i okay when freshly made other then that pass","anyone that thinks this is good pizza has probably never had actual

out about it because a now ex used to work there and now i tell everyone i can","ther apparently other items on the menu than sushi or so e been told","if that matters to you","i feel everyone there

critic but aria is the best","i go here like once a month","almost every person who works there calls me by name when they see me","the atmosphere is fancy enough that you can impress a date but

always impressed with how well they know the menu","not a huge drinker so always ordering virgin drinks","e never had a non alcoholic drink that did taste like a cool spring breeze lol rachel is the

eaten at this road house numerous times and always have great service and great food","laid back atmosphere good steaks good food fresh friendly staff","food was wonderful ","but service sucked","my friend asked the waitress at least 3 different times after his drink was bone dry for a refill it took her all of 15 20 mins to actually take his drink and refill it","she had no humor what so ever my fiance asked if they offer military discount on meals and its almost as if she was offended and ran to the manager and came back with a snippy no when in fact they actually do","again food was very good but will not be returning to this location","order filet mignon with a salad and vegetables","requested steak medium","came out raw","sent it back came raw again","next time it sent back the

in around 6pm and ordered salmon and the middle was raw raw","i was eating at the lucky texan about 3 times every two weeks","i have now switched to outback on independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks","steaks excellent service good","john owner of trh should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge

got the chance to experience","the person who brought my niece her food fingers was in her plate touching her food","when i asked him about this he said well at least my hands are clean","i immediately asked for a manager who did seem concerned about my problem","after that my other niece was brought out chicken fried steak which she ordered chicken fried chicken","once again the manager came out totally unconcerned about the mishap","my order i placed to go was to have no dressing on the salads but on the side so my salads would get withered quickly","however tha not what i

living this is not how you handle it","i understand things happen","i how a company handle those challenge is a sign of the company ","with managers like this no wonder this store seems to have so

they changed this would be the best place in 100 miles","still highly recommended and lets be honest charlotte is a hot spot for quality food much less ft mill i a chain restaurant waste land","you

awful","i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens","the grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges","if that was bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate","it was so overbearing i could taste the potatoes or the collards","i called the waitress over and told her i could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that i wanted and i said no just take it off the bill","now since this restaurant is listed as an upscale restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was","well i guess not as no one came so i guess they do really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket","we also had a cup which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp lobster bisque and there was a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty","we paid the bill but since they do seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again","on the way home i was reading their reviews and wished that i had done that before going as there were many bad reviews","visited

review pike s soda shop for you","most of the people writing that this place is an authentic soda shop or retro have lived through the 1940 s or 50 s to know what a real soda shop looks like that is checkered marble floors plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors","pikes is none of that","i a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar","so in that regard haven driven thirty minutes to get there we were disappointed","in terms of the food i ordered what was labeled meatloaf on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top","i added a side of mac and cheese and didn t care for that either as there were bread crumbs baked in","my father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad","you of thought they d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place","he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was just fair ","when dinner was over i handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that i d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out","while we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way i said sure and then i asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave","he looks at me right in the face two feet away and says what are you talking about","i said we ve been trying to settle up and can t because you can t process cards","this momo just kept staring at me until we basically got up and i told him to blank the hell off","what a dumbblank anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave","the service as far as drink refills and delivering meals was at the 5 to 10 tip level and no more","1 out of 5 stars ","toda special of carrot cake was served cold did seem fresh at all","strawberry milkshake tasted artificial as if were made with syrup instead of real strawberry ice cream too sweet and not quite the right texture","coke float was pretty good but i pretty hard to mess that up","service was quick and friendly and ambiance was right on for a old fashion soda shop","my husband and i were recently at the city grille for his birthday the service was great and the

planet","the honey chicken pasta is solid","and the bread pudding is amazing","will be back","great food","pricey obviously","not my type of crowd though","not food related but character this past weekend my wife and i where traveling from michigan to florida we stopped at the plaza where azteca is located to decided where to spend the night","as we where leaving my little puppy opened the rear window and jumped out and ran away my wife and i searched for over 24 hours to no avail we had to continue on due to having to return to work","i stopped into azteca and asked if i could leave my name and number encase anyone seen her","so we drove on with broken hearts","well to my delight at midnight i received a phone call from the night manager saying they found our puppy needless to say we

always great and always hot","great buffet and menu fair prices","this is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached not a brewery","if yoe trying to eat here on a budget","do","tha the best advice i suppose","aim away from peak hours for better service and i personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles especially for the price not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up fried chicken but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing and the waffle was nothing special","to make matters worse it was served vertically on a spike without any clear way to approach it","rambling","my general view of the menu is that i focusing too much on being gourmet and not enough on being","well good","another reviewer got it spot on the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas","great and slowly rotating selection of belgian and farmhouse style beers one of the better places for the style in charlotte if tha what yoe into which is what earns it the third star but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd tha used to the cit higher end dining and nightlife","if yoe got money to burn on food or mixed drinks or yoe just here for the beer you could do worse than a night at heist","worst mexican food e ever eaten so bland and flavorless","dried out chicken what a waste of 30","food was not good and service was poor at best","my wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it","the waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay","she replied that it was to her liking that it was very dry bland and not very good at all","the waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes","he removed the dish from the table","he did even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal","we will never eat at this restaurant ever again","my advice would be to look elsewhere for mexican food","ther much friendly and delicious mexican restaurants out there","dammmmmm good food and dammmmmm good service","great beer and atmosphere","i was here for the monday run club","service to get a beer was slow","great place for lunch dinner or a night out","try some pineapple rum or even ff in rum","yes quite crazy","decent beer selection but cocktails are superb","food is very good and they have a sunday brunch buffet that is very good","it will cost you 19","95 and i would say i worth it","on the buffet you will find scrambled eggs grits sausage bacon honey baked ham steak home fries sweet potato fries donuts salami pepperoni cheese assortment pastry assortment flatbread pizza assortment waffles biscuits and gravy mussels and your choice of an a la carte menu item","not the best experience e had at a chil","nobody comes to seat you","there is almost always food or trash all over the floors","they had to redo orders for 3 other tables while we were in there and our food was made properly either","they take forever to get you your food and then it will probably be wrong","take your money elsewhere unless you enjoy chil food so much you can ignore the other things","just an overall bad experience going to this place","i went here with my family around 2pm memorial day weekend","there were a total of 7 in my party including my older parents","we asked for a place to sit outside with some shade","i was told by the blond hostess she could not accommodate a large party outside in the shade","she offered us a table inside or suggested we wait until it became cloudy","i had to ask","when did she think it would be cloudy","lol","anyways i told her no thank you i will come back when i cloudy","i was not impressed","now after reading some of these reviews i am happy we went

waiting on the chips","ordered spinach dip","then i ordered a monster cookie","came out with melted ice cream burnt cookie and the cookie was cold","claimed the ice cream was melted because the cookie was hot","laughable","terrible experience at a good restaurant in general","not a good place","the sushi was fine but when my guest and i tried to return the hibachi scallops we both purchased the manager came out guns blazing and charged us for both meals even though we had taken maybe a bite between us and despite multiple mistakes by the server and the manager we still were charged full price for something that was subpar and untouched","i do not recommend this restaurant","i love this place","the food is always great and the good part","its affordable","i would give it 5 stars but there is always a wait to be seated and the service tends to be a little slow","my favorites are the lemon pepper chicken dijon chicken mushrooms and the legendary monster cookie","go check out this place for yourselves","great staff and they know how to make one hell of a sandwich","rarely disappointed here","the only thing that bummed me was that i did get a dessert treat reward for my birthday like i usually do","however the drink reward was a very refreshing treat at the right time for me","i will go back for the simple fact that it was clean and a wonderful atmosphere","but i was not all that impressed with the food","it seemed to be you basic asian hibachi food served differently","i was expecting more fusion ","but perhaps its just what i ordered","yes yes yes yes yes","the amount of food for the price and the food taste great","that broccoli and cheese casserole is devine and the carrots are carmelized to perfection","mistakenly placed my pickup order at the wrong

management new owner new atmosphere","the biggest leanest fastest and friendliest in town","go see for yourselves","sushi rolls are meh at best","we order 8 or 9 different rolls","all were just ok ","dull favor all around but well prepared","ima guess that either their food supplier is the best or they are trying to cut costs","i will not be coming back as there are many better sushi places in charlotte that are the same price or cheaper","on another note the atmosphere and the scenery is top notch here","back area usually unkempt and needs sweeping from 1p close but bathroom is cleaner than some other locations","cashiers are friendly well trained","menu is the same as other paneras creative health conscious food choices","good sushi kind of pricy","good food but mediocre service","broken ice machine and too loud music playing","my very first visit to cheddars was an awful experience","first the seating is horrible we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because cheddars does have enough seating for large parties","i called to make reservations cheddars does do reservations","not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different sections is oblivious","sure this location loses out on a lot of money behind this very reason","do better cheddars","i will never bring my family to this place again","such a

as people have praised","mine were soggy to me","just do think wings fast food material","wings should be cook with time not left around waiting for someone to order them","thank goodness the salmon was tasty because we really came for the ribeye which they did have","we then ordered the delmonico and found out they were out of that my wife then ordered the prime rib and to her dismay that was not available either","so she settled for the salmon and i got the filet","on firebirds you are a steak house and on a monday night no steak","well not a selection","absolutely ridiculous","waited txt

the other ends of greenville","sorry does cut it","i do not recommend paying for such service from this location","always spectacular","food service and decent prices for a upscale casual steak house ","i get a steak every time less once or twice having pasta or a burger at lunch","steak is the way to do it","decent whiskey prices so wl sometimes go well before our reservation to sit at the well

provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers","this lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay","she then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us","we were given a review card before leaving","the experience was ok but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone","thanks

good","service was very good and so is the atmosphere but let me tell you about the food","bread was microwaved to make it soft","two of us ordered mussels and the beef sliders","mussels were bland

college for a reason and i so i never have to work in an environment like this just terrible","i love this place the food is delicious cheap and the nighttime service is beyond awful","i witnessed several parties walk in that were seated until 10 minutes after","there was a group of young men who were seated that did have a waitress attend to them until 15 minutes after and had not gotten drinks","before leaving there was a group of young adults who were waiting to be seated three different times because the tables were still dirty","service was very slow and innitentive","that being said our waitress was very nice and the food is always wonderful","so i a win lose","while the wait was long because there was only one waitress serving the entire restraunt the service was excellent

table was clean","we had to ask 3 times for them to clean but it was only grudgingly","our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum","for some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3 straw thin french fries it was not worth the time nor the money","putting up with it due to the inclement weather we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house","this of course infuriated us more","how a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me","great wings","i had the gold rush wings were just as described sweet and spicy","cheese fries could be better","servers were nice and as a party of 16 we kept them

tables and most were empty","i was long after the lunch hour","the staff were very nice but i was expecting my food to take as long as it did","maybe 8 10 minutes","okay with this kind of wait but my

the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes","i just moved them aside and started to eat my burger","after the first bite i could tell it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done","all i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it","all and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut ed spinach was good","as soon as i settled into the atmosphere of the restaurant the extremely polite waitress gave me and my wife excellent service","the food arrived promptly exactly as ordered and was incredible","have to order pancakes","definitely a place i would visit often if i did live so far away","it is good breakfast food they can ease up on the butters and oils a bit their veggie scramble is good and of course their applebutter with

rude and unwelcoming attitude","it hurt to pay 24 for the meal and 20 tip i felt they did deserve","the food was nothing to go home and talk about","guess the only reason they have a clientele is

much better","i will never buy from this location again after the same awkward and or rude experiences with the workers at this one","fyi guys customers do not appreciate your sarcasm and

the kin kitchen gives back to the community is a plus","super dissapointing especially because i love the philosophy of the place","i had tell chicken sandwich with sweet potato mash","walked in and was told that as a single person i had ro eat in the bar area","which was annoying","i was ignored for 12 minutes while waiting to pit in my order an older man came in 9 minutes after me and was seated greater and his order was taken before mine","finally i got to order","the food was not good for the price the chicken salad was boring the bread was old and stale","the sweet potato mash was watery stringy and bland","if this restaurant was not a 501c3 designation i would have refused to pay the food was that bad","i do know if it because a single woman i got treated so badly or what","i

husband and i were sat at a very small table near the front because the place fills up quickly and they only have large outdoor tables","he enjoyed his pimento cheese pinini but the bacon was a bit overdone","love the idea of the place love the atmosphere and music","i had low expectations of finding authentic chinese food at this chain but was nonetheless disappointed that the lemongrass chicken salad hardly had any chicken and the dressing was more lemon than was lemongrass the asparagus was seriously undercooked the garlic noodles were barely garlicky and the berry ginger shortcake had no ginger","however the fiery wontons were good though pricey at 7 for 6 and our server moua was great","go for the ambiance but not if you actually want any asian flavors","if you have the misfortune to be seated in the first banquette on the right be prepared to have your enjoyment of your meal continously interrupted by the wait staff banging their water pitchers right behind your head even if you ask the manager to have them quit","that space was never meant for staff use and it needs to be blocked with a nice plant or a piece of plywood over it so customers can enjoy their evening","funny this review would not post until i raised my review from 2 stars to 3","tha one way to look better","like all p","f","chan they can be busy","what i recommend are reservations","staff

ridiculous","now e frequented this subway before and have never come across this problem","how are you the sandwich spot and run out of bread","tha like the pizza place running out of pepperoni","unacceptable","blackened flounder with crawfish sauce on a country ham grit cake is one of the best dishes i ever tasted i get it every time","highly recommend it","stopped in after reading the reviews","great appetizer menu","oysters were perfectly cooked pepper jelly was awesome and the fried green tomatoes were the best e ever had","the rest of the menu was disappointing

be returning to jak","double cut maple glazed pork chops with candied apples","enough said","great service phenomenal food","a little pricey but you get what you pay for","totally worth every penny","glad my house is only one mile from this slice of heaven","not sure it was the best place for my two small children maybe more of a date night place","but worth trying no matter what","we had a very bad experience at this place a year ago but wanted to give it a go one last time but we are disappointed that it happened again at the same location","the waitress is very rude and did bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she did bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed btw we were at pf chan from 8 45 pm and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that i have never seen someone talk to a customer","this was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like pf chan","i would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever","i would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us","what can i say","i a subway","a sandwich good fast cheap","amazing waitresses very funny and attentive","great food definitely with a little twist","many options to try out","i recommend this location though it was hot while we were there","wonderful","just looked at my receipt and saw i was charged 8","25 tax when it should be 1 less","astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurants unenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring food","while i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasn t busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson","despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver","and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all","too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive and these too were incorrect","i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to prepare","the waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen staff true professionalism","the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologize","despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect","we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree","that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i don t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary","my entree was entirely forgettable indeed a few days later i have no recollection of what it was ","i do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy","the two word review why bother","we were in charlotte over the weekend and ate here on saturday night","with it being a saturday night and a

time","once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food at the same time","the server brought our drinks back pretty quickly","another server brought our food out refilled our drinks and got us silverware","our original server passed by when we were almost done eating","he asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously did hear us ask for refills and our check","we had to ask another server for our check","she asked who our server was we did not know his name but did point him out to her","when she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said oh ","i do think i was the first person to have problems with him","he did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks","i left a 10 cash tip and wrote 0 on the bill","the transaction processed through my bank today","the boy who did have time to wait on us added 9 to my bill for a total of a 19 tip which he did not deserve","i tip based on my service","i would never leave no tip even with horrible service","i am very disappointed","i know 9 is not a lot of money to some but again i did not authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill","needs new management","used to be a good place to go but terrible service the last 3 times e gone","they also brought me my check before i was ready to leave","oh well","for best service and experience request your waitress be kim she is great food will be on time and just the way you want it","got a salad","there was some confusion as to whether or not we were ordering from lunch or dinner menu","i said i wanted the dinner salad","half a chicken breast 3 raw

were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill","the wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor","so that whole aspect was a sales pitch","for 95 done buying","the oyster selection was incredible at least in terms of presentation ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country","by the time you returned to your seat you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same","not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor","other selections were fried oysters over breaded and void of any oyster flavor oysters rockefeller fine enough and a clam crostini too fishy after about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers you realize tha it","there is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it and why would there be i 95 so i m going into it thinking it is a meal ","but they do even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal","overall with the alcohol included it is probably at most a 55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards","friday happy hour 3 7pm","1 oysters and the fiery muscles are amazing","we usually sit in the bar

waitress got into a huff and was very short with us","would not recommend","had a pretty bad experience there tonight","arrived at 8 and we were served our food until an hour and ten minutes later","service was okay and my wife enjoyed the ravioli but my steak was bad","you can get a decent sirloin from anywhere and for an equal or better price","it was the most pathetic steak i have ever

palmiers pal mee a when you stop by","terrible","gave this place another chance but nothing had changed and the service was still horendous","we were seated and a server did not appear for a considerable amount of time","i will give my money elsewhere for better customer service","wonderful cafe and bakery of french delicacies croissants tarts macaroons etc","that is open 24 7 with free wi fi","better than starbucks for in house baked items and crafted coffee espresso beverages","but this place is pricey","sheeze","i was ready in my kevin hart voice ","my daughter will go all hours of the night to study","however if you are not from charlotte your gps googlemaps waze will lead you through some sketchy and less desirable areas of the city","we stopped in on a day trip and had the

a venue","throughout my night there in excess of thirty women were up on top of the speakers on the dancefloor dancing which was absolutely fine and accepted by all staff","however when a male friend of mine got up to dance he was told to get down and leave the venue","a huge double standard and very sexist","when another friend tried to peacefully reason with the secuirty staff simplyto keep our friend in the venue he was suddenly without warning put into a full headlock by the 230 pound staff member","so here we have a placid peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled rammed head first into the floor laid on top of once again with hugely excessive force","the whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance","he was then picked up by a second security staff the two thugs combining to ram his head into a pillar as he was removed from the premises comolete with a split head and very very confused to what had happened","disgraceful security and the manager when asked to be spoken to was not interested at all obviously supporting thuggery more than friendly business","huge regrets for spending any of my hard earned money here","food was terrible staff cooks do listen","i got curb side to go as i was in a hurry","i had ordered salmon and asked for no seasoning pepper on it as very allergic","after i had pulled off after paying i checked it and surprise

waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce","sure enough it came out with a red sauce","if the price of the meal was in the 60 range i might not be so critical","but when you pay what i consider to be a pretty pricey cost","add to that the fact that the 9 glass of wine came from an 8 bottle it was good wine but i do need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction i would say it was just

good thing about this place were drink prices","the drinks themselves could be served better","now not one to be a drink sob when you wanna get a good buzz on then serve is however you can","but when you ask for a jager bomb or an irish car bomb then i think their respective shots should drop bomb into the drink","in theory that would happen if the shot was in","say","a shot glass","they served the shot is a plastic medicine cup","that makes it difficult to drink bomb enjoy","the shot was just floating in the pint glass","does anyone remember exxon valdez","plastic is made of oil and oil floats","also one more thing","the music is so damn loud that i ca hear myself think about how loud the music is","i understand","it tries to be classy what with the guy in the bathroom handing you

things like i not my f ing responsibility if you lost your keys i do have your keys you f ing stupid b ch and stop giving me attitude about your keys when she clearly was ","i was standing right next to her and after repeated comments like this heard enough and said hey man the girl lost her keys and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here what is your problem","he immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me what the f k are you going to do about it","something i do think was necessary at all at this point ","he proceeds to call over security who says hey le talk about

defiantly on point especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen","that did a lot","our personal server was rude and i understand it was busy i work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother","if it was for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster","would have been nice to see some

several times and the laundry cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived after 6pm ","in general they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff","but our room was clean so that is good","this is your typical hyatt place so if you are familiar with the brand and layout you know what to expect","the lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful","this hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators which are in the hallways right behind the front desk also used for access to from the lobby and other rooms ","this was definitely a problem during high traffic times you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators","very poor layout in my opinion","otherwise the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a hyatt place so if you like the layout it will be the same","i really like the sitting area i quite large and has a big l shaped sofa and a separate desk","really nice","the only thing i do like about these rooms is the open bathroom area","the sink is basically in the bedroom so i very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready like brushing your teeth without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping","but if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time no problem","negatives small lobby and breakfast area cramped if busy overflowing trash cans outside a lot of laundry cleaning carts in hallways very cramped elevator location","positives large rooms new modern room was clean and quiet","this hotel has a high quality interior and very nice touchs to it","i think that this place has potential but i think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out

encourage her to let us help her","for anyone that looks after someone who has needs the little things mean the world to people who take care of them","from the bottom of my heart thank you","however hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people","it is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people especially at night as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped","bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location","there was some confusion or miscommunication about the room i had booked","i booked a two bed room and what i received was a one bed room with a pull out couch","the other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed","truth be told i was not stoked to sleep on

may not be charged for a particular policy one stay but be charged for it another time","there is apparently a 30 damage fee to cover any hotel property if ruined","i was not charged this fee before so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill","however the kind desk manager joel was able to remove it","this is my second time at this hotel and both times i had my dog","the first time i was not charged 75 even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file ","for the record the dog is well behaved","when i asked the manager name","about it he simply told me that it was policy","i told the manager i understood but if there if a policy follow through with it at all times","he removed it but honestly the money did matter","it is more important that i can be informed","i was frustrated","i felt like i was being dismissed from the conversation by having the charge dropped","i want to be informed so i am prepared for the charge on my bill","bottom line if you have a policy follow through with it at all times","inconsistency kills a business","i do not like to be surprised with fees i was not informed of nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular

plenty of television downstairs to lounge and watch","it was a great experience with kind and friendly staff","to be quite honest service is poor","e attented this resturant few times","at first they treated me as a costumer should be treated","it was until later that i was treated very poorly","maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior e incounter is unacceptable","i would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out","i was patient until i realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress","as a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking","but of course thats just me second when my family i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the kitchen was close and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half before closing time but even then that did much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it was until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me ","they refuse to serve my family i but served them no questions asked","i think not ","an apologe was not even giving to us","thirdly the dj is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song","i as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an

to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime","so i went to the location no to long ago ","the lady that was making my sandwich just started putting random stuff on my

required","aaron was helpful as well","sleep room was nice","refrigerator in room along with a separate living area","this has been our favorite mexican spot in charlotte for over a decade","i bring my family and friends here regularly","the atmosphere is warm and relaxed the staff is friendly and we have literally never had a bad dish in the 50 times we been here","personal favorites include the boracha chicken and the shrimp tacos","totally decent drink specials 3","99 dirty martin","karaoke nice view over the little lake","highly recommend","this particular day i went and the employee was rude and act as if she could speak","it was an indian lady","and sandwich was very skimpy that me and my wife paid for","bad service today","brought the kids and all i can say is they had a blast","from the giant bounce houses to the arcade with games for all ages and to the bowling both full size and mini bowling it could have been have been a better place to get the kids all worn out while having a good time","we will definitely be back","we brought a group of 18 in this past weekend","it was a fun time and the logistics of it all went smooth but the lanes kept breaking down","at one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well","we probably wo come back to sports connection next time for our group bowling","the staff was great","but the lanes need some serious tlc","when yoe paying per hour i frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed","again great staff","just poor machinery on the lanes","was a lot to do","fun for the kids for sure","packages made it a decent deal but games cost more than average and the staff is helpful for the most part","main complaint i have is that

excellent","thee toppings always seem fresh","my wife and i always make our own pizza so i ca attest to their house pizzas","the only negative is the service can be inconsistent","it may be really good service or just out right bad","depends on your server","tuscan ribeye not available on a friday evening","shrimp scampi was cold then when i ask to be warmed up he told me that he would give me

exciting place and modern interiors","kids would love to eat inside bus","worst staff imaginable","just a bunch of rude teenagers that want to take your money and could care less about you having an

variety that the others do","i went with the turkey salsa verde sandwich","hearty amount of turkey and good flavor","was a bit messy soggy and it pretty well fell apart towards the end but still good

beautiful","however the chicken was undercooked and disgusting completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick","the texture","i know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it","i hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked","he looked at it and insisted it was fine that i how the cook it on the flat top or something like that","he did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all just snatched my plate up and walked away","i sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes","he completely ignored me for the rest of the meal as if i had done something wrong","i noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so i guess they figured all

i","at the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out","because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional 400 until the next day","we called and emailed kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again","fortunately the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds","the unprofessional demeanor of kay did not take away from our beautiful evening and it may not take away from yours either","just be cautious of the fees

of control child in ice skates who ran over my wifes foot","my wife was in regular shoes and not participating in any ice skating activities but was still injured","management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities ","i was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an activity ","this should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas","accidents are very likely to happen during crowded times if this is not mandated","this was a great experience","it is a little on the pricey but i feel like yoe

stars pending review my husband and i ate here on jan 1 2016 and the food was awful","i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens","the grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges","if that was bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate","it was so overbearing i could taste the potatoes or the collards","i called the waitress over and told her i could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that i wanted and i said no just take it off the bill","now since this restaurant is listed as an upscale restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was","well i guess not as no one came so i guess they do really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket","we also had a cup which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp lobster bisque and there was a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty","we paid the bill but since they do seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again","on the way home i was reading their reviews and

good sized meal","margaritas are pretty good","steak usually good but no more inconsistent than any other steakhouse","this was one of my favorite places in uptown but something changed","i went back recently and not only was the service absolutely horrible the food was as well","they did away with our favorite salmon dish and changed to some other fish that was inedible","presentation was beyond basic the fish was on an essentially empty plate","service was some of the worst e ever had the lady could understand anything","not to mention we had planned a birthday surprise dropping off cake and candles before dinner","the waitress literally came out and asked the entire table should i put the candles in the cake or do you guys want to do it","ruining the entire surprise for the birthday","wo

couple rolls the exotic and a sweet potato caterpillar do forget the eel sauce and ginger dressing on the side","finished it off with a banana foster and green tea ice cream yumm ","this is a great place for nigeria sushi and sashimi","the rolls are okay but the traditional sushi is top notch","the lunch buffet is excellent and a great value","it can get very crowded and loud","toda special of carrot cake was served cold did seem fresh at all","strawberry milkshake tasted artificial as if were made with syrup instead of real strawberry ice cream too sweet and not quite the right texture","coke float was pretty good but i pretty hard to mess that up","service was quick and friendly and ambiance was right on for a old fashion soda shop","this place has gone down hill for sure","ate there today with my boys took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we placed our orders","it was busy","my so kids meal came out with no fries","asked the guy who brought it to us for fries and he seemed annoyed","needless to say i wo return","oh and i was charged the wrong amount to top it off","20 bucks for 2 kids meals","lol","e only been once","the food is okay but nothing to write home about","i like the concept of the homemade sodas but it is something i want all the time","would be 4 stars but my service was pretty lackluster the time that i went","much has been written about pik old fashioned soda shop in local print and web publication so we as a family decided to give it a try over fathe day weekend","now let me personally review pike s soda shop for you","most of the people writing that this place is an authentic soda shop or retro have lived through the 1940 s or 50 s to know what a real soda shop looks like that is checkered marble floors plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors","pikes is none of that","i a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar","so in that regard haven driven thirty minutes to get there we were disappointed","in terms of the food i ordered what was labeled meatloaf on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top","i added a side of mac and cheese and didn t care for that either as there were bread crumbs baked in","my father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad","you of thought they d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place","he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was just fair ","when dinner was over i handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that i d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out","while we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way i said sure and then i asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave","he looks at me right in the face two feet away and says what are you talking about","i said we ve been trying to settle up and can t because you can t process cards","this momo just kept staring at me until we basically got up and i told him to blank the hell off","what a dumbblank anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave","the service as far as drink refills and delivering meals was at the 5 to 10 tip level and no more","1 out of 5 stars ","so i used to actually like this restaurant however after one experience this has all changed","the food is ok and the servers are less than thrilled with life","needless to say nothing is consistent at this place and it is unfortunate because a movie helped guarantee its success so wha the excuse","if you want a quick place to eat with

very cool mentor to me and everyone else in the restaurant business in charlotte","i spent many nights drinking shots and delicious concoctions in this place","it always reminded me of new york pubs especially in the winter ","the food was always top notch and the best pub food money could buy","when i think of charlotte epic restaurants i think of al mik gus sir beef south 21 the penguin the diamond the knife and fork the coffee cup the liberty holly farms the barclay the cajun queen catherin fenwic the laurel market hotel charlotte red rocks open kitchen and the list goes on","love the atmosphere this place is great in terms of service it really surprised us as we werent sure what to expect","the food is great but holy smokes the beer selection is really solid too","really laid back

at the plaza where azteca is located to decided where to spend the night","as we where leaving my little puppy opened the rear window and jumped out and ran away my wife and i searched for over 24 hours to no avail we had to continue on due to having to return to work","i stopped into azteca and asked if i could leave my name and number encase anyone seen her","so we drove on with broken hearts","well to my delight at midnight i received a phone call from the night manager saying they found our puppy needless to say we rushed 3 hours back to retrieve our little puppy","to me this shows the character of the employees at azteca and going above and beyond","i give this a 5 star review is because of the exceptional service i received by my waiter douglas","he was very prompt proactive and polite","initially i was irritated because my boyfriend and i have been served for awhile after being seated","doug came to check on us and served us for the rest of the evening","the food was also excellent despite the extremely sweet courtesy key lime pie","wow just wow","parmesan chicken was delicious waitress tosha is awesome what a pleasant relaxing dinner","by far the best

comfortable","staff is ok","overall the food is safe and nothing to write home about","decent beer selection but cocktails are superb","food is very good and they have a sunday brunch buffet that is very good","it will cost you 19","95 and i would say i worth it","on the buffet you will find scrambled eggs grits sausage bacon honey baked ham steak home fries sweet potato fries donuts salami pepperoni cheese assortment pastry assortment flatbread pizza assortment waffles biscuits and gravy mussels and your choice of an a la carte menu item","worst mexican food e ever eaten so bland and flavorless","dried out chicken what a waste of 30","food was not good and service was poor at best","my wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it","the waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay","she replied that it was to her liking that it was very dry bland and not very good at all","the waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes","he removed the dish from the table","he did even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal","we will never eat at this restaurant ever again","my advice would be to look elsewhere for mexican food","ther much friendly and delicious mexican restaurants out there","subpar","everything food service atmosphere subpar","great beer and atmosphere","i was here for the monday run club","service to get a beer was slow","i went here with my family around 2pm memorial day weekend","there were a total of 7 in my party including my older parents","we asked for a place to

cloudy","i had to ask","when did she think it would be cloudy","lol","anyways i told her no thank you i will come back when i cloudy","i was not impressed","now after reading some of these reviews i am happy we went elsewhere","my suggestion to groups of more than two","go elsewhere","this is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached not a brewery","if yoe trying to eat here on a budget","do","tha the best advice i suppose","aim away from peak hours for better service and i personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles especially for the price not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up fried chicken but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing and the waffle was nothing special","to make matters worse it was served vertically on a spike without any clear way to approach it","rambling","my general view of the menu is that i focusing too much on being gourmet and not enough on being","well good","another reviewer got it spot on the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas","great and slowly rotating selection of belgian and farmhouse style beers one of the better places for the style in charlotte if tha what yoe into which is what earns it the third star but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd tha used to the cit higher end dining and nightlife","if yoe got money to burn on food or mixed drinks or yoe just here for the beer you could do worse than a night at heist","rarely disappointed here","the only thing that bummed me was that i did get a dessert treat reward for my birthday like i usually do","however the drink reward was a very refreshing treat at the right time for me","good sandwiches and soups in a casual cozy

experience ever ","nobody told me to sit here ","almost empty and nobody sits me down","asked for sharly temple and they said they do have it ","i got it yesterday wth","not the best experience e had at a chil","nobody comes to seat you","there is almost always food or trash all over the floors","they had to redo orders for 3 other tables while we were in there and our food was made properly either","they take forever to get you your food and then it will probably be wrong","take your money elsewhere unless you enjoy chil food so much you can ignore the other things","just an overall bad experience going to this place","nice atmosphere good food lots of plugins to do work","good for business meetings or a good quick meal","it would let me give it 0 stars","it was absolutely

all","the whole staff was annoyed and not there to do their job","whooooooo so glad to walk across the street to tgfridays it was awesome over there","they have those ziosk so one would think i got my

is","enjoyed myself quality time with my oldest boy","the service was good","i ordered the firecracker roll it was very good but a little on the small side for the price","the sushi place that i usually eat at has much bigger rolls for that price","i would probably eat here again","the shrimp and grits need to be stricken from the menu","just plain horrible","staff was friendly though and nice","i have had much better","if the carolina panthers need a good home cooked meal please inbox me","i will hook you up","tried merts for the first time today with my team from job celebrating one of my team member birthday and what am embarrassing experience","the service was the worst i have ever experienced my entire life here in charotte to the point the manager actually snatched my salad

it away","i tried this place while out on business","i must say that i did not enjoy the food nor the service","no one had a smile on their faces and they were not friendly at all","i ordered food to go and when i reached my office to eat the food was burned","i would not recommend this place to anyone","my boyfriend and i were in town just to get away and have some fun decided to try somw soul food","the first thng we noticed was the cute cozy decor and welcoming staff","i got the fried chicken with mac and chz and collards and it was sooo good","not over seasoned perfect","my boyfriend got fish and the same sides he did not share one bite lol","definitjy will make this our spot when we come back on our monthly date nights","i will go back for the simple fact that it was clean and a wonderful atmosphere","but i was not all that impressed with the food","it seemed to be you basic asian hibachi food served differently","i was expecting more fusion ","but perhaps its just what i ordered","not a good place","the sushi was fine but when my guest and i tried to return the hibachi scallops we both purchased the manager came out guns blazing and charged us for both meals even though we had taken maybe a bite between us and despite multiple mistakes by the server and the manager we still were charged full price for something that was subpar and untouched","i do not recommend this restaurant","good sushi kind of pricy","e got to be honest many people rave about mer but i just do get it","for me the chicken is not that fabulous i good but not worth five stars

you stood by the deep fryer and cooked your own meal after you leave so word up","sushi rolls are meh at best","we order 8 or 9 different rolls","all were just ok ","dull favor all around but well

or cheaper","on another note the atmosphere and the scenery is top notch here","small plates are awesome","bloody marry bar on sundays is great","excellence date spot before a night out","get the brussels or the low country hash","this establishment is not wheelchair accessible","my wife went in to speak to the hostess about the barriers and they could not provide any accomidations","so we went a few blocks down to eat at mer awesome soul food wheelchair accessible ","i have filed a ada complaint because of barriers to get into and around inside the cafe","my husband and i thought we would enjoy a sunday brunch here","we were quickly seated and then ignored","we sat for 10 minutes with a menu ready to order and never had a server greet us or ask for an order","they were not crowded","no excuses in that department","i would give vida no stars if the option was available","this place is unprofessional unauthentic","the host red head slim female is not inviting when

refills","nothing i had to ask her to do things ","she only came to my table about two three times before checking out","i guess the young girls that work in this restaurant feel they need to cater to a specific population but this place is even high end dining to kiss that much a ","in addition the food was nasty and cold not worth my money parking and time","i will never ever return","from the outside and even at first blush upon walking inside the dandelion market has the feel of an irish british pub which i guess makes sense once you read the blurb on the back of the menu about what the dandelion market was in england","nice relaxed atmosphere","good beer selection with an emphasis on the locals the cocktails we tried were also very good","the food here is tapas style so my wife and i split 5 plates which were all amazing and more than enough","shout out to our bartender wolf w lf","who made this a 5 star experience","by a mile the best service we had in the city during our stay","i love dandelion market","i what tapas is supposed to be","consistently original well made and perfect for sharing","i think e probably had everything at this point and do remember being disappointed","upstairs is a good time afterwards too if for no other reason than to watch them haul that massive table up to the ceiling","freakin awesome","mango margarita was perfect","every bite of every item was delicious","i recommend the carne asada black bean mash","i have no idea what they did to make black beans taste like a dessert","i know that sounds weird but i will order them every time i go","i dont think there is a nicer way to put this but when e when drinking i the greatest mexican e ever had","i made the mistake of coming sober once and it was horrible","hashtag no

awesome","a nice place to go out on a date","i definitely recommend this place if you enjoy thai food","my very first visit to cheddars was an awful experience","first the seating is horrible we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because cheddars does have enough seating for large parties","i called to make reservations cheddars does do reservations","not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different sections is oblivious","sure this location loses out on a lot of money behind this very reason","do better cheddars","i will never bring my family to this place again","the sushi was amazing","will definitely visit again","highly recommend it","the gyoza app was also delicious","pretty good thai restaurant","a bit pricey but it has that uptown rent to pay","good friendly service","tasty dishes","worth a dinner for sure","this place is prob considered one of the best sushi places in the entire city of charlotte","coming from l","a so used to really good sushi everywhere","but this place is like an l","a 5 but if i was to rate it based of the sushi here in nc i would say its a 8 out of 10","over all i would say give this place a try its deff considered good in my eyes","pretty impressive","been all around different cities and states to try different dimsum restaurants and have to say this place had some of the best

great selection of dim sum","i thought i had experienced a variety of asian foods until i ate lunch at the dragon court","this restaurant offers a nice family environment with a majority of asians supporting the establishment","dragon court is truly ethnic offering the real deal","loved the food and environment","although the restaurant is located in an old shopping center with a pot hole ridden parking lot you tend to forget about this after entering the dragon court because they offer a clean environment","and great service","i just wish i could find a similar restaurant in georgia","been a few years since i been but ready for a sunday brunch food was awesome","best chinese restaurant in charlotte","this cantonese restaurant offers very delicious dim sum","so much better quality than the other cantonese restaurant named dim sum ","wha even greater is that dragon court also has price advantage than dim sum","i will never go to dim sum for dim sum after i tried dragon court","although they were a little shorthanded when i went","salsa and chips were less watered down than most mexi restaurants and more tasty","the meat in the tacos lengua and asada i ordered were very tender and delicious and the server made up for the lack of plenty staff","looks like everyone there does their part","the decor and theme is well put together and the lighting is very dim especially at night and at that time i best to get a window seat","satisfied with my meal and service but i believe they need more alcoholic drinks and portions for the price","good food fun to eat on the porch over the water especially on a warm breezy day","the service here is inconsistent though","we had great service sometimes and mediocre service sometimes regardless of how busy they

order after dropping waters off at our table","at the time there was just 4 of us later it became 11","when it came time for the bill just about everyon was incorrect","after writing out what some of us should have on our bill they still messed it up","it took over 30 minutes before they got it right ","as compensation another waiter half heartedly gave some of us a voucher for a drink or app no

staff is awesome and the food has been awesome every time","i am forever a fan","always spectacular","food service and decent prices for a upscale casual steak house ","i get a steak every time less once or twice having pasta or a burger at lunch","steak is the way to do it","decent whiskey prices so wl sometimes go well before our reservation to sit at the well appointed and easy on the eyes bar","thank goodness the salmon was tasty because we really came for the ribeye which they did have","we then ordered the delmonico and found out they were out of that my wife then ordered the prime rib and to her dismay that was not available either","so she settled for the salmon and i got the filet","on firebirds you are a steak house and on a monday night no steak","well not a selection","very good food the only problem i had at this location was the service","the server left for almost 20 minutes after we asked for a second to look at the menu","we also did get a refill on our drinks until almost 30 minutes after being empty","even then it was the server who helped but someone who wandered past","i probably would come back to this specific location they seemed overwhelmed","always a nice experience here","this particular red robin underwent serious surgery a few months back","it looks fantastic in there now","however the new ziosks which are the at table ordering and payment devices are very confusing","the waiters and waitresses will generally let customers pay another way without having to use the ziosk","the food is always great","however i wish that they gave you more bottomless fries each time","excellent place","had outside seating that saved us from waiting for hours on the benches","excellent meals the delmonico ribeye was excellent and

were seated around 7 ","i personally appreciated that instead of being turned away","we both ordered the cuban sandwich and the food came very fast waitresses were constantly checking in refilling

around doing 4 pints and i wish all other breweries and restaurants would do the same","this would be a three star review but the service just pushes it up to four when it comes to the standard casual american dining this is fighting with chedda for the best spot in the university area and harle is far more accessible","the foo good especially for the price","e had some inconsistencies though a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy a couple of steaks that have been too well done for the medium rare i normally order","i wish there were more appetizing healthy options the vegetables you

everything on the buffet like the squid for example i can still find plenty of options","the waiters and waitresses have always been courteous and seem to be happy to help","not sure why there are so

front desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there","well i admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places but i still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several spanish speaking dudes who were checking out before me and who were clearly pointing looking and making fun of me","however i would give

still flowing with juices ","kevin gave us outstanding service even giving us a free dessert to take home out of his own pocket","we could not have had a better dining experience on our wedding night","many thanks to del friscos","the tabouli salad is good but very inconsistent","e ordered the same dish 7 times in the last 4 weeks and i different every time","unfortunate","ordered delivery through their delivery partner the garlic naans had a weird sourness and the paneer was dry","rice was stale will not recommend it if you are planning on ordering delivery for one","will cost you 40ish 25 for food 12 for delivery fees and 5 more for tipping and will not be satisfying","given my past experiences here i was astounded at how quickly a restaurant can go downhill","this was not fine dining","the atmosphere was not unlike a sports bar","it was very noisy tvs were everywhere it seemed and there obviously was no dress code","i did not see any of the usual wait staff most seemed new and inexperienced for a quality establishment","the entrees poor quality meat over seasoned and undercooked","one of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order","the waiter barely graced our presence never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated","after we ordered the lemon cake he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill","just a note on your signature dessert stale hard and crusty","at least a few days old","we did speak to the manager about the terrible experience","he quickly became defensive perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed","this place is awesome because ther something for everybody","soups salad bar yummy different kinds of sandwiches","even gluten free sandwiches","not to mention ther free ice cream","the best filet mignon steak e ever tried sophisticated atmosphere and helpful waiters ","definitely the place to visit","fantastic lunch buffet","always something different yet they do keep enough of the classics on the buffet to satisfy those less familiar with indian cuisine","love all the chutney options to go along with it","we used to order food to office about few months back","their quality degraded as days went by","hariyali chicken shrimp is no more hariyali","i guess the original chef retired","disappointing food","i repeat disappointing people seems good and polite nice service but food was not worthy of a restaurant","i enjoyed the food","i had a really pleasant experience and marlon was super","he was very polite and knowledgeable about the menu and the food","i will definitely come back anytime soon","thank you","just got a whole ham muffaletta for me and friends","it appeared to be missing half the meat","there are too many choices in the sandwich world to put up with that crap","wo happen again","great food beautiful atmosphere but very very expensive","today i have ordered the mighty wild salmon salad that supposed to be a mix of organic greens beets beans beets nuts and more","i was very disappointed ","the lettuce was not fresh and there were non of the the mentioned ingredients beets nuts beans and more ","my salad came with lettuce croutons and salmon","at least it was fresh i

salad bar is good and you get free ice cream","as a vegetarian i am impressed with the options","the zucchini panini was very good and i liked having chips and salsa as a side","the place had a number of tables and most were empty","i was long after the lunch hour","the staff were very nice but i was expecting my food to take as long as it did","maybe 8 10 minutes","okay with this kind of wait but my preconceived notion was to expect a panara sub 5 minute meal","definitely worth it and did subtract from my experience","i wish that there were locations in my part of the country as i would definitely eat at them","always fresh no matter which one you are visiting","i have visited 4 different locations in 4 different cities and i said the same for all clean fresh and delicious","good jaso deli","better menu items than other chains","free ice cream","love the all you can eat salad buffet","the chicken pot pie soup is amazing","i love this place the food is delicious cheap and the nighttime service is beyond awful","i witnessed several parties walk in that were seated until 10 minutes after","there was a group of young men who were seated that did have a waitress attend to them until 15 minutes after and had not gotten drinks","before leaving there was a group of young adults who were waiting to be seated three different times because the tables were still dirty","service was very slow and innitentive","that being said our waitress was very nice and the food is always wonderful","so i a win lose","a dive bar for sure but everyone there is very friendly","it is a great place to grab a beer or two ","i like the food as well but it may not be to everyon taste as it is all fried","i usually enjoy a good shake and fries here but not today","we waited over 30 minutes for food before walking out we just literally left","the whole time our waitress never bothered to come over and apologize nor did thr manager","we watched multiple get their food and leave","pretty pathetic place","i would give them negative stars if i could","the prices are phenomenal here and offers a great atmosphere for watching sports or just hanging out","large outdoor patio with fast service","e had salads wings grilled chicken and had absolutely no complaints about the place yet","go bills","stopped in to get a quick dinner","i will say like many other bars in charlotte it has over priced food with poor service","i felt because i am not a regular they just sort of ignored me","i ordered my burger med rare","at first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes","i just moved them aside and started to eat my burger","after the first bite i could tell it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done","all i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it","all and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut ed spinach was good","on a weekend my party of 5 waited over an hour we entered at 8 to eat at the raved steak and shake","the place was packed but we were seated quickly","our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we crazy and told us that the table was clean","we had to ask 3 times for them to clean but it was only grudgingly","our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum","for some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3 straw thin french fries it was not worth the time nor the money","putting up with it due to the inclement weather we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house","this of course infuriated us more","how a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me","i was a waitress here for about 2 months it was not a great workplace environment ","everyone came to work high on marijuana and complained about management","second shift was the absolute worse","we were always busy but our greedy managers had us low on staff","none of the employees were valued therefore no one saw value in their job","as a waitress you get paid 2","13 hourly","the tips were okay but it just did seem worth it when your managers do schedule a person to do dishes shakes etc","all night and expect you to work overtime with out being paid","i go to college for a reason and i so i never have to work in an environment like this just terrible","dark and cozy bar with nice porch and beachy vibe","while the wait was long because there was only one waitress serving the entire restraunt the service was excellent because the server kept a good attitude even while being swamped with tables and still hurried as quickly as she could","this was a 2am visit","it is good breakfast food they can ease up on the butters and oils a bit their veggie scramble is good and of course their applebutter with their buiscuit is jummy","my daughter and i arrived at 2 34 and the teenager host look at us weird and said we close soon","i said we know yoe still open for 1 2 an hour no","he started stuttering and a woman who i assume to be the owner asks the host is there a problem","she did give him a chance to answer back cut him off and said just let tthem know we close at 3 on the dot","how rude is that","talked as if we were there","zso i asked the host so what happens at 3","they pull the plate away from you and toss you out on the street","he was actually contemplating an answer","extremely rude and unwelcoming attitude","it hurt to pay 24 for the meal and 20 tip i felt they did deserve","the food was nothing to go home and talk about","guess the only reason they have a clientele is because thee the only breakfast place around","overpriced for average food","really 5","00 for 1 piece of french toast","ihop is better than this","great wings","i had

sausage literally made my mouth water","not the good watery but the before you vomit watery","the grits upset my stomach even further and at one point the bite of grits had a clump of uncooked grits in it","i had 4 bites of my food and was done","the eggs were bland and jut gross","i would not recommend this place at all","not even if yoe starving","what a waste of money and time","i usually come to this location but never go back again","server never introduced herself","salad bar was horrible","no utensils for items there i had to let the people know not only did they not replace the food that im quite sure customers were sticking their hands in to get they just but utensils in them","i watched a server fan her face and hair with customers to go containers and then deliver a customers plate of food with a floor cleaner in her hand as well","returned my order and had to wait 20 mins to get my replaced order","after waiting my and my boyfriend just left","nasty customer service and nasty servers","i do not recommend this place to eat","i will also be forwarding this review to their corparate office","smh","the guy who usually works the register along with a few other guys is the rudest and most unprofessional group of young guys working anywhere","of course chipotle food is awesome but these guys who think theyre having these inside jokes in front of customers are just beyond annoying","the one in southpark mall has actually has better food maybe if only bcs the service is so much better","i will never buy from this location again after the same awkward and or rude experiences with the workers at this one","fyi guys customers do not appreciate your sarcasm and conversations about people while you serve them rudely","its truly awful ordering food here","the b e s t food in charlotte best food ever","i would have thought this place would have this type of food with that name and location and how it looks","this place has got to be one of the best hidden treasures of charlottes dining","my husband and i ca wait to get back there and eat again","try the creamed corn","yummy","this is one of our favorite restaurants in town","great classic southern dishes and a seasonally adjusted menu with special offerings","they have the best fried chicken and shrimp and grits in town","also the restaurant serves as a great ministry operating as a non profit that looks to hire people who need a second chance in life","all the profits go to feeding the hungry and outreach in the local community","we enjoyed our dinner very much great fried chicken and comfort food creamed corn butter beans mashed potatoes ","i had the halibut special with shrimp corn and peppers","the flavors were excellent","ice cold beer and wine and great seats outside rounded out a great dining experience","the fact that the kin kitchen gives back to the community is a plus","super dissapointing especially because i love the philosophy of the place","i had tell chicken sandwich with sweet potato mash","walked in and was told that as a single person i had ro eat in the bar area","which was annoying","i was ignored for 12 minutes while waiting to pit in my order an older man came in 9 minutes after me and was seated greater and his order was taken before mine","finally i got to order","the food was not good for the price the chicken salad was boring the bread was old and stale","the sweet potato mash was watery stringy and bland","if this restaurant was not a 501c3 designation i would have refused to pay the food was that bad","i do know if it because a single woman i got treated so badly or what","i can only compare my treatment to the man sitting 1 chair down from me","sadly i will no longer be recommending this business to my friends and family nor will i be returning","best chicken salad i have had in a long time","love the atmosphere but my husband and i were sat at a very small table near the front because the place fills up quickly and

reservations","staff we interacted with were great","hostess waiters managers","food was great as well","if you have the misfortune to be seated in the first banquette on the right be prepared to have your enjoyment of your meal continously interrupted by the wait staff banging their water pitchers right behind your head even if you ask the manager to have them quit","that space was never meant for staff use and it needs to be blocked with a nice plant or a piece of plywood over it so customers can enjoy their evening","funny this review would not post until i raised my review from 2 stars to 3","tha one way to look better","amazing waitresses very funny and attentive","great food definitely with a little twist","many options to try out","i recommend this location though it was hot while

dish when i got it it was dry like the heat in charlotte","i asked them why","they said we only use a curry paste not actually curry","wtf you it says curry meaning it should have curry aka gravy","this place make no sense the manager or the staff does know anything wha going on","the staff has a damn attitude yoe in the damn service industry you need to learn how to handle people no matter what the problem is","if you do like dealing with people then go find another job","i had low expectations of finding authentic chinese food at this chain but was nonetheless disappointed that the lemongrass chicken salad hardly had any chicken and the dressing was more lemon than was lemongrass the asparagus was seriously undercooked the garlic noodles were barely garlicky and the berry ginger shortcake had no ginger","however the fiery wontons were good though pricey at 7 for 6 and our server moua was great","go for the ambiance but not if you actually want any asian flavors","blackened flounder with crawfish sauce on a country ham grit cake is one of the best dishes i ever tasted i get it every time","highly recommend it","ate there for dinner","very disappointed","dining room was uncomfortably warm","table was sticky","fish was underseasoned with too little sauce","grit cake was greasy","vegetables were oily","table service was slow","usually love small local places like that but i will not be returning to jak","we had a very bad experience at this place a year ago but wanted to give it a go one last time but we are disappointed that it happened again at the same location","the waitress is very rude and did bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she did bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed btw we were at pf chan from 8 45 pm and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that i have never seen someone talk to a customer","this was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like pf chan","i would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever","i would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us","decent food and atmosphere","hostess service is sub par and prices are expensive for both lunch and dinner","lunch sandwiches burgers are 12 lunch plates start at 15","they do have covered outdoor seating","there is nothing special about this place in my opinion","very great staff","food is fresh","smoothies are the best and taste fantastic","for best service and experience request your waitress be kim she is great food will be on time and just the way you want it","came here initially for the lobster mac and cheese it was probably the only thing i enjoyed here","beware prices are expensive even for lunch","i had a burger and was impressed with it at all the cocktails were anything special and for 10 i would choose beer next time","i am a huge panera loyalist so this review is hard to write","this location as well as the location in cmc levine hospital down the

had no trace of my order","i showed them the confirmation still up on my phone screen and was told the make it right then and there","fine","i go to the front order breakfast for my mom as well come back 5 minutes later and told we out of that souffl ","il be about 20 minutes for the next batch","i have to be to work in 20 minutes","nothing rapid about this here","then i was told they have a four cheese souffl so i agree to take that instead only to have the woman turn around and tell me they do have that either because thee selling it to someone else","great","i was offered a breakfast

breast 3 raw sliced onions some pico cheese dressing and lettuce","all for 9","49","been a long time since i felt this ripped off going out to eat","astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurants unenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring food","while i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasn t busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson","despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver","and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all","too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive and these too were incorrect","i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to prepare","the waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen staff true professionalism","the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologize","despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect","we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree","that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i don t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary","my entree was entirely forgettable indeed a few days later i have no recollection of what it was ","i do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy","the two word review why bother","located in downtown charlotte","this was the meetup location for the enlightened at the ingress abaddon anomaly","it is centrally located","we went here for valentin day brunch","first we were told that there was a half hour wait","miraculously a table showed up for us in the bar","the waitress seemed like she had never waited tables before","we were brought water after a table that sat down after us did","the waitress told us the specials but when we went to order found out that 1 3 of the menu was not available because they were out","she did not offer substitutions or other options which we heard her give other guests","the food was barely average and the grits notably came out barely warm","the ham was over salted and my fianc omelet special with ham had no ham in it","we will be moving to this area soon and will likely not return to the liberty","we were in charlotte over the weekend and ate here on saturday night","with it being a saturday night and a comic book convention weekend we knew it would be busy","the hostess was very polite","she told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time","once we were seated we ordered our drinks and food at the same time","the server brought our drinks back pretty quickly","another server brought our food out refilled our drinks and got us silverware","our original server passed by when we were almost done eating","he asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously did hear us ask for refills and our check","we had to ask another server for our check","she asked who our server was we did not know his name but did point him out to her","when she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said oh ","i do think i was the first person to have problems with him","he did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks","i left a 10 cash tip and wrote 0 on the bill","the transaction processed through my bank today","the boy who did have time to wait on us added 9 to my bill for a total of a 19 tip which he did not deserve","i tip based on my service","i would never leave no tip even with horrible service","i am very disappointed","i know 9 is not a lot of money to some but again i did not authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill","so after leaving the gym i decide to pick up a sandwich for dinner at subway","turns out they had no white bread left","the most basic type of bread","the only two options were wheat and honey oat","just ridiculous","now e frequented this subway before and have never come across this problem","how are you the sandwich spot and run out of bread","tha like the pizza place running out of pepperoni","unacceptable","a special panera","paner menu is standardized so how can one location stand out from the others","by having the best service and friendliest people","also very good attention to cleanliness","will eat here again","awesome beer and wine selection","great food","extremely hesitant to order seafood our side of florida spoiled ","bit the fish and chips was excellent","what can i say","i a subway","a

experience","and the staff ","my wife and i loved their food and drinks","my wife has a gluten allergy and this restaurant was able to offer up some options","friday happy hour 3 7pm","1 oysters and the fiery muscles are amazing","we usually sit in the bar or patio and drink wine and knosh on happy hour specials","service was decent food took forever to come and was made wrong ","had thec turk club sand with out tomatoes it came with tomatoes","bread not toasted","will never eat there again ","hot taco much better ","this review relates only to the annual oyster feast","we attended the 3rd annual one on october 2nd 2014","price per head was 95","wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill","the wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor","so that whole aspect was a sales pitch","for 95 done buying","the oyster selection was incredible at least in terms of presentation ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country","by the time you returned to your seat you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same","not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor","other selections were fried oysters over breaded and void of any oyster flavor oysters rockefeller fine enough and a clam crostini too fishy after about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers you realize tha it","there is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it and why would there be i 95 so i m going into it thinking it is a meal ","but they do even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal","overall with the alcohol included it is probably at most a 55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards","i love the atmosphere but have had more poor meals than good ones here","i a fun place to hang out for happy hour after work","the burgers really are some of the best in the city and the dinner menu is generally excellent","i stepped out and tried the portobello lunch sandwich and was pretty underwhelmed","should be called great food on montford","very busy place which speaks to not only i popularity but i incredible atmosphere and food","highly recommend you check this place out","very underwhelming","for the price of the mothe day brunch the quality was extremely poor","hash browns were burnt and tasted stale","prime rib was medium rare but still tougher than a 2 steak","oysters you could tell were frozen and were extremely slimy","in the business so i understand the concept of trying to maximize profit but this was just a rip off","40 and 20 for kids i was expecting much much better","we will never return and i would give 0 stars if possible","first time i put a review","but wow","exactly","wow ","just amazing hot good tasty","and with the smile","just here for few days but already know coming back tomorrow","great service","do expect a reservation to be honored we waited an hour with a reservation for 2","food was good steak and the brie that came with the cheese plate was the best part of the meal","good sub and great service what else can you ask for","possibly some of the worst service ever","had to go ask for a server after we had waited for about 20 minutes after being seated","salads came out but we did have silverware and had to go ask for some","when our order was dropped off the delivery person took off without asking if we needed anything","had to go ask for our server to come so we could get things we needed","server did come back till about 10 min after we finished eating","food was impressive either just so so","go here all the time for business lunches as well as after work drinks","the place is conducive to both offering a busy but open large bar and dining area with ample t and good drink and food specials","the fries here are amazing maybe tha just me","waiters waitresses can sometimes be hit or miss but thats everywhere with turnover being norm at a restaurant of any caliber but the bartenders are always chipper friendly and helpful","food is a bit pricey for what you get","do go here hungry and

made any sandwiches i lunchtime and no ones in here","i hope the sandwich is good","wrong sandwich order was taken they called my name but once i got back to work and opened the box it was the wrong sandwich","i wo be going back","the place is large and food good but overpriced for a sandwich","jimmy johns while not hot is half of the cost while subway is cheaper too","oh and is everyone that works here angry","for the main course ordered a rare steak","it was a very thin cut of meat not very good","the coconut shrimp appetizer was clearly frozen and it was overcooked as well","rubbery shrimp made the dish barely edible","the sauce it came with was good albeit generic","servers were pretty busy but really nice","did not get silverware with my appetizer and server forgot bread i asked for","overall the service was good and i an okay place to go if you are looking for that restaurant chain experience with generic food guilty pleasure ","a wonderful blend of cheap chic and upcycled regalia makes this place one of a kind","the real star of the show however is the food","authentic french creations are both expertly prepated and very reasonable","the pastries are freshly

would be waiting in line","amazing food","we stopped in on a day trip and had the chocolate cake strawberry cake napoleon and reeses square all so delicious but the cream puff and eclair where really hard and dry on the outside","the 2 ladies helping us were really nice helpful and smiling","the decor is just awesome","we will definitely be back next time we are in town","ate with group here on a saturday night while in town for a soccer tournament","this is pretty on par with other ruby tuesda","i love the salad bar and sides which is why i go","the food is consistenly pretty good for a chain and they have healthy options between the salad bar and vegetable sides steamed brocolli summer vegetables etc","i just love that ruby tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a

thing about this place were drink prices","the drinks themselves could be served better","now not one to be a drink sob when you wanna get a good buzz on then serve is however you can","but when you

alleys are not in the best shape","there is a bar on deck which is convenient this is a good place to go for casual drinks and bowling with friends not for competitive bowling","was a great atmosphere at first","then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost","after not checking if the keys were turned in and initially saying no he began to respond with things like i not my f ing responsibility if you lost your keys i do have your keys you f ing stupid b ch and stop giving me attitude about your keys when she clearly was ","i was standing right next to her and after repeated comments like this heard enough and said hey man the girl lost her keys and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here what is your problem","he immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me what the f k are you going to do about it","something i do think was necessary at all at this point ","he proceeds to call over security who says hey le talk about this over here pointing to a spot away from the bar ","i agreed saying yes le talk about it after being very displeased with

area","our server was m","i","a","for the majority of my time there","beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time","bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer","big applause to the hostess who did a fantastic job greeting customers running food bussing tables and trying to smooth over guests","a large thank you to the one server not named ashleigh who stepped in and took care of us and not too thrilled customers around us","food was defiantly on point especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen","that did a lot","our personal server was rude and i understand it was busy i work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother","if it was for the

hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out","i was patient until i realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress","as a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking","but of course thats just me second when my family i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the kitchen was close and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half before closing time but even then that did much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it was until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me ","they refuse to serve my family i but served them no questions asked","i think not ","an apologe was not even giving to us","thirdly the dj is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song","i as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee","as an employer i would seek for both more respectful

for a treat","st louis ribs were a bust rarely do i ever say that on any review ","my brother ordered the hot mess burger","from his reaction they should leave that off the menu","it was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich","my mother ordered the smoked salmon","cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred","i concur","finally i ordered the select 4 combo","my review on food is above","my quarrel is the portion size","for 34 i expected","more","again maybe i am hard on the portion cause i wanted more brisket or cause i wanted to make

lights and soft music","the service is good","no waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress","orders are there in a timely manner and table is cleared almost instantly","the

salads","it also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice","at the table they bring many different side dishes which is something i have experienced at a brazilian steak house before","even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one","i did however had an issue with the valet parking i did get as stated on their website update site with start time

mention it is all you can eat","tons of different meats to choose from and cooked all different ways","try as many as you like or as few as you like however i recommend trying as many as you

guests","there was not one time during the evening that kay came to greet my husband and i","at the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out","because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional 400 until the next day","we called and emailed kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again","fortunately the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds","the unprofessional demeanor of kay did not take away from our

skates who ran over my wifes foot","my wife was in regular shoes and not participating in any ice skating activities but was still injured","management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities ","i was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an activity ","this should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non

to this place we looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order when our food came out she did bring out the fries we had ordered which you have to pay 1","99 extra for we

rice was cold","it was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us because they were closing as i was filling up my drink i

well","to top off the excellent food we had great service including the struggles that come from eating out with a toddler","the only thing i can nit pick is that the seating was uncomfortable to me

enjoy a glass of good wine at a much more reasonable price than i expected","good marketing fish market","that and the food already has me coming back","i give this a 5 star review is because of the exceptional service i received by my waiter douglas","he was very prompt proactive and polite","initially i was irritated because my boyfriend and i have been served for awhile after being seated","doug came to check on us and served us for the rest of the evening","the food was also excellent despite the extremely sweet courtesy key lime pie","very disappointed and will never return","i bragged about this restaurant to visiting out of state family because of a past experience","the shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall","we ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash","the server argued and said the chef said it had lobster","fyi my family is from maine and knew there was no lobster","the crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought","when we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold","the peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream","this experience embarrassed me for having to bring my family and friends to such a low level high priced dinner","never again","this place is more infamously known for its all you can eat sushi lunch buffet","the lunch buffet is good but a sushi quality is not that high lots of extra rice cream cheese tempura and lower quality fish","that said i fast filling and only 12","i call it a rock and rolls lunch","the real treat is to come here for dinner in the evening","the che choice sashimi bowl is amazing","high quality and a higher price but well worth it","everything was great","from the crispy calamari to the shrimp spicy miso soup","we got the spicy udon noodles with

5 stars pending review my husband and i ate here on jan 1 2016 and the food was awful","i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens","the grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges","if that was bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate","it was so overbearing i could taste the potatoes or the collards","i called the waitress over and told her i could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that i wanted and i said no just take it off the bill","now since this restaurant is listed as an upscale restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was","well i guess not as no one came so i guess they do really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket","we also had a cup which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp lobster bisque and there was a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty","we paid the bill but since they do seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again","on the way home i was reading their reviews and wished that i had done that before going as there were many bad reviews","visited january 2016","love the atmosphere this place is great in terms of service it really surprised us as we werent sure what to expect","the food is great but holy smokes the beer selection is really solid too","really laid back place","we will be back for sure","i was raised on al mik food","zan was a mainstay and very cool mentor to me and everyone else in the restaurant business in charlotte","i spent many nights drinking shots and delicious concoctions in this place","it always reminded me of new york pubs especially in the winter ","the food was always top notch and the best pub food money could buy","when i think of charlotte epic restaurants i think of al mik gus sir beef south 21 the penguin the diamond the knife and fork the coffee cup the liberty holly farms the barclay the cajun queen catherin fenwic the laurel market hotel charlotte red rocks open kitchen and the list goes on","toda special of carrot cake was served cold did seem fresh at all","strawberry milkshake tasted artificial as if were made with syrup instead of real strawberry ice cream too sweet and not quite the right texture","coke float was pretty good but i pretty hard to mess that up","service was quick and friendly and ambiance was right on for a old fashion soda shop","in the heart of uptown alexander michaels give a taste of charlotte culture that is filled with flavor and flare","i recommend this place to anyone that is looking to see what the coty is all about","thank you for existing","love the decor friendly staff good variety on tap food is fantastic","good wings","the what it is is well on its own planet","the honey chicken pasta is solid","and the bread pudding is amazing","will be back","e only been once","the food is okay but nothing to write home about","i like the concept of the homemade sodas but it is something i want all the time","would be 4 stars but my service was pretty lackluster the time that i went","not food related but character this past weekend my wife and i where traveling from michigan to florida we stopped at the plaza where azteca is located to decided where to spend the night","as we where leaving my little puppy opened the rear window and jumped out and ran away my wife and i searched for over 24 hours to no avail we had to continue on due to having to return to work","i stopped into azteca and asked if i could leave my name and number encase anyone seen her","so we drove on with broken hearts","well to my delight at midnight i received a phone call from the night manager saying they found our puppy needless to say we rushed 3 hours back to retrieve our little puppy","to me this shows the character of the employees at azteca and going above and beyond","food was great","only complaint is that when i asked about a kids menu i was told we have a kids cheeseburger and grilled cheese got the kids cheeseburger","9","50","i asked about this when i saw it on the bill and was told we do really have a kids menu","great place for lunch dinner or a night out","try some pineapple rum or even ff in rum","yes quite crazy","much has been written about pik old fashioned soda shop in local print and web publication so we as a family decided to give it a try over fathe day weekend","now let me personally review pike s soda shop for you","most of the people writing that this place is an authentic soda shop or retro have lived through the 1940 s or 50 s to know what a real soda shop looks like that is checkered marble floors plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors","pikes is none of that","i a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar","so in that regard haven driven thirty minutes to get there we were disappointed","in terms of the food i ordered what was labeled meatloaf on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top","i added a side of mac and cheese and didn t care for that either as there were bread crumbs baked in","my father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad","you of thought they d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place","he said the lettuce was dry and the meal was just fair ","when dinner was over i handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that i d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out","while we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way i said sure and then i asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave","he looks at me right in the face two feet away and says what are you talking about","i said we ve been trying to settle up and can t because you can t process cards","this momo just kept staring at me until we basically got up and i told him to blank the hell off","what a dumbblank anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave","the service as far as drink refills and delivering meals was at the 5 to 10 tip level and no more","1 out of 5 stars ","very tasty mexican restaurant","they even give a small dessert complimentary","pleased and would go back","this place has gone down hill for sure","ate there today with my boys took 15 minutes to get our drinks after we placed our orders","it was busy","my so kids meal came out with no fries","asked the guy who brought it to us for fries and he seemed annoyed","needless to say i wo return","oh and i was charged the wrong amount to top it off","20 bucks for 2 kids meals","lol","so i used to actually like this restaurant however after one experience this has all changed","the food is ok and the servers are less than thrilled with life","needless to say nothing is consistent at this place and it is unfortunate because a movie helped guarantee its success so wha the excuse","if you want a quick place to eat with mediocre food and service by all means try this place out","they have those ziosk so one would think i got my table and i can order right no wrong you sit there 15 minutes before the waiter can enable it or take the order themselves and waste our time","i went here with my family around 2pm memorial day weekend","there were a total of 7 in my party including my older parents","we asked for a place to sit outside with some shade","i was told by the blond hostess she could not accommodate a large party outside in the shade","she offered us a table inside or suggested we wait until it became cloudy","i had to ask","when did she think it would be cloudy","lol","anyways i told her no thank you i will come back when i cloudy","i was not impressed","now after reading some of these reviews i am happy we went elsewhere","my suggestion to groups of more than two","go elsewhere","it would let me give it 0 stars","it was absolutely horrible","minutes of waiting to be seated from a young woman who obviously did not want us there and the couple before us","waited 10 min before we walked out before we ordered","it was not busy at all","the whole staff was annoyed and not there to do their job","whooooooo so glad to walk across the street to tgfridays it was awesome over there","was ok ","no place is prefect","it is what it is","enjoyed myself quality time with my oldest boy","this is my second review ","horrible ","horrible","worst experience ever ","nobody told me to sit here ","almost empty and nobody sits me down","asked for sharly temple and they said they do have it ","i got it yesterday wth","guacamole made table side is good as it should

here for the monday run club","service to get a beer was slow","awesome food and service","went to restaurant week and i had ny strip wife had filet mignon both were outstanding","mine was rare to perfection","subpar","everything food service atmosphere subpar","great food","pricey obviously","not my type of crowd though","worst mexican food e ever eaten so bland and flavorless","dried out chicken what a waste of 30","food was not good and service was poor at best","my wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it","the waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay","she replied that it was to her liking that it was very dry bland and not very good at all","the waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes","he removed the dish from the table","he did even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal","we will never eat at this restaurant ever again","my advice would be to look elsewhere for mexican food","ther much friendly and delicious mexican restaurants out there","this is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached not a brewery","if yoe trying to eat here on a budget","do","tha the best advice i suppose","aim away from peak hours for better service and i personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles especially for the price not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up fried chicken but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing and the waffle was nothing special","to make matters worse it was served vertically on a spike without any clear way to approach it","rambling","my general view of the menu is that i focusing too much on being gourmet and not enough on being","well good","another reviewer got it spot on the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas","great and slowly rotating selection of belgian and farmhouse style beers one of the better places for the style in charlotte if tha what yoe into which is what earns it the third star but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd tha used to the cit higher end dining and nightlife","if yoe got money to burn on food or mixed drinks or yoe just here for the beer you could do worse than a night at heist","not the best experience e had at a chil","nobody comes to seat you","there is almost always food or trash all over the floors","they had to redo orders for 3 other tables while we were in there and our food was made properly either","they take forever to get you your food and then it will probably be wrong","take your money elsewhere unless you enjoy chil food so much you can ignore the other things","just an overall bad experience going to this place","decent beer selection but cocktails are superb","food is very good and they have a sunday brunch buffet that is very good","it will cost you 19","95 and i would say i worth it","on the buffet you will find scrambled eggs grits sausage bacon honey baked ham steak home fries sweet potato fries donuts salami pepperoni cheese assortment pastry assortment flatbread pizza assortment waffles biscuits and gravy mussels and your choice of an a la carte menu item","by far the best fine dinning experience e had in charlotte","other fine restaurants i","e","rut chris sulliva do even compare","best steak ever","best appetizers lobster mac cheese is baked heaven","great staff and atmosphere","if you want to treat yourself to the best go to the capital grille","good sandwiches and soups in a casual cozy environment","they have several bread types amongst them a baguette like tasty although chewy","black bean soup and tomato are excellent","rarely disappointed here","the only thing that bummed me was that i did get a dessert treat reward for my birthday like i usually do","however the drink reward was a very refreshing treat at the right time for me","my husband and i were recently at the city grille for his birthday the service was great and the food was cooked to perfection","i would definitely recommend this restaruant for a perfect evening out for any occasion","the food is amazing the service is even better my wif birthday and the whole restaurant knew it and she was just so happy","our server george was just great","the entire establishment is above anyone ","this is just the best place in town hands down","we love it here and will be back very soon","thanks capital grille for another awesome night ","mistakenly placed my pickup order at the wrong store","spoke with the manager showed my proof of payment and a new order was quickly made for me","she totally fixed my screw up","back area usually unkempt and needs sweeping from 1p close but

plugins to do work","good for business meetings or a good quick meal","best steak house in town bar none","friendly staff","food is always great and always hot","greeters at the door are horrible at

if thee not here to work and provide great customer service","this needs to be taken care of immediately","i love the restaurant and have visited other locations for cheddars but this is by far the worst","gabrielle was an excellent server","she was professional engaging polite and very attentive","me and my wife have been dining for years and never had a more pleasant experience","gabrielle is a great asset to loga roadhouse","we could not have asked for a better experience","definitely a 5 star experience","thanks gabby","food was warm when i got it","turned cold waiting on the chips","ordered spinach dip","then i ordered a monster cookie","came out with melted ice cream burnt cookie and the cookie was cold","claimed the ice cream was melted because the cookie was hot","laughable","terrible experience at a good restaurant in general","i love this place","the food is always great and the good part","its affordable","i would give it 5 stars but there is always a wait to be seated and the service tends to be a little slow","my favorites are the lemon pepper chicken dijon chicken mushrooms and the legendary monster cookie","this place is always nice to eat at","i love coming here just for casual dinners","their food is reasonably priced and i love the friendly staff","i have had a single bad server","i also never too busy to have to wait more than half an hour","dammmmmm good food and dammmmmm good service","great buffet and menu fair prices","yes yes yes yes yes","the amount of food for the price and the food taste great","that broccoli and cheese casserole is devine and the carrots are carmelized to perfection","i will go back for the simple fact that it was clean and a wonderful atmosphere","but i was not all that impressed with the food","it seemed to be you basic asian hibachi food served differently","i was expecting more fusion ","but perhaps its just what i ordered","not a good place","the sushi was fine but when my guest and i tried to return the hibachi scallops we both purchased the manager came out guns blazing and charged us for both meals even though we had taken maybe a bite between us and despite multiple mistakes by the server and the manager we still were charged full price for something that was subpar and untouched","i do not recommend this restaurant","the service was good","i ordered the firecracker roll it was very good but a little on the small side for the price","the sushi place that i usually eat at has much bigger rolls for that price","i would probably eat here again","e got to be honest many people rave about mer but i just do get it","for me the chicken is not that fabulous i good but not worth five stars good","the menu does add some variety to charlott uptown but it does so without really backing up the offer with flavorful food a clean restaurant and consistent service","p","s","you will smell like you stood by the deep fryer and cooked your own meal after you leave so word up","good sushi kind of pricy","i tried this place while out on business","i must say that i did not enjoy the food nor the service","no one had a smile on their faces and they were not friendly at all","i ordered food to go and when i reached my office to eat the food was burned","i would not recommend this place to anyone","sushi rolls are meh at best","we order 8 or 9 different rolls","all were just ok ","dull favor all around but well prepared","ima guess that either their food supplier is the best or they are trying to cut costs","i will not be coming back as there are many better sushi places in charlotte that are the same price or cheaper","on another note the atmosphere and the scenery is top notch here","my very first visit to cheddars was an awful experience","first the seating is horrible we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because cheddars does have enough seating for large parties","i called to make reservations cheddars does do reservations","not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different sections is oblivious","sure this location loses out on a lot of money behind this very reason","do better cheddars","i will never bring my family to this place again","the shrimp and grits need to be stricken from the menu","just plain horrible","staff was friendly though and nice","i have had much better","if the carolina panthers need a good home cooked meal please inbox me","i will hook you up","my boyfriend and i were in town just to get away and have some fun decided to try somw soul

wheelchair accessible","my wife went in to speak to the hostess about the barriers and they could not provide any accomidations","so we went a few blocks down to eat at mer awesome soul food wheelchair accessible ","i have filed a ada complaint because of barriers to get into and around inside the cafe","my husband and i thought we would enjoy a sunday brunch here","we were quickly seated and then ignored","we sat for 10 minutes with a menu ready to order and never had a server greet us or ask for an order","they were not crowded","no excuses in that department","from the outside and even at first blush upon walking inside the dandelion market has the feel of an irish british pub which i guess makes sense once you read the blurb on the back of the menu about what the dandelion market was in england","nice relaxed atmosphere","good beer selection with an emphasis on the locals the cocktails we tried were also very good","the food here is tapas style so my wife and i split 5 plates which were all amazing and more than enough","shout out to our bartender wolf w lf","who made this a 5 star experience","by a mile the best service we had in the city during our stay","such a

not say a thing how are you doing refills","nothing i had to ask her to do things ","she only came to my table about two three times before checking out","i guess the young girls that work in this restaurant feel they need to cater to a specific population but this place is even high end dining to kiss that much a ","in addition the food was nasty and cold not worth my money parking and time","i will never ever return","good food but mediocre service","broken ice machine and too loud music playing","food was good and nice atmosphere","just upset that everything was spicy","sensitive

blowing and the proportions recently dropped off significantly esp","the for the price ","cool environment and pretty good food for a reasonable price","do expect anything really special but it is

reasonable prices","this place has a nice cajun feel to it","the music is very cajun and the decorations are very cajun and the food is pretty tasty","the only thing that takes away from this place for me seems to be the uncajun portions","you do get a whole lot for what you pay for here like you would if you were down in louisiana","but if you are looking to try to at least mimic that cajun taste and feel this is a good place to try","we stopped by at razzo cajun cafe for lunch the other day","we were seated and placed our orders quickly","besides other food 3 in our group ordered gumbo 2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo","the food came out shortly after placing our orders","it was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix up on the gumbos","the person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa","as this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy i address the mix up with the wait staff wh only reply was yes the kitchen gets this wrong all the time ","what","unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind","sorry razzo cajun cafe this could have been a

compensation another waiter half heartedly gave some of us a voucher for a drink or app no manager stopped by to apologize ","after it was all said and done they still charged me for 2 tickets after reassuring me that the wrong one would be refunded","such a shame the servers ca figure it out since the food and drinks were great","excellent place","had outside seating that saved us from waiting for hours on the benches","excellent meals the delmonico ribeye was excellent and the fillet i tasted was perfect","gluten free options were there with several steaks and sides and a few of their other dishes","very helpful staff as well","love this place","i always clean the staff is awesome and the food has been awesome every time","i am forever a fan","thank goodness the salmon was tasty because we really came for the ribeye which they did have","we then ordered the delmonico and found out they were out of that my wife then ordered the prime rib and to her dismay that was not available either","so she settled for the salmon and i got the filet","on firebirds you are a steak house and on a monday night no steak","well not a selection","if yoe going to make me pay for extra

midwood","since we were in the area we stopped at workma for a libation","we found a spot at the end of the bar and the bartender chris quickly attended to our service","we chatted with him about how we ended up at workma and by the time we left that evening we had made a new charlotte friend","when we made the move to charlotte a couple of months later we stopped back at workma and chris immediately came over and welcomed us back","i highly recommend the workma friend for a great atmosphere","however being not of the younger generation i find that on weekend late nights the bar tends

30 minutes that their open so people ca call in pickup orders","i tried to call in a order for pickup at 8 30 they close at 9 two weeks ago because i live literally 2 minutes from the place and got nothing but busy signals for 5 minutes straight","i drove up there to order the to go order in person and while i was waiting in line behind another person who walked in right before me i decided to try to call and see if the phone would ring since the person working the register was clearly just hanging out and not doing a thing i now 8 40 ","sure enough the line was still busy and not a single

was gonna call ","smdh thievery and deception at this location and then miss papa johns hung up on me ","horrible experience ","never again","i have gone to noda bodega a couple times for sandwiches and am astonished by how long it takes them to prepare simple sandwiches","when i arrived today there was no line and i placed my order right away","the employees did not move with any sense of urgency and spent about twenty minutes preparing my sandwich","the time would bother me if the employees were making involved sandwiches or if there were other orders in the queue before mine","what frustrated me most was what supposed to be a warm toasted sandwich was room temperature by the time i paid","this is not the first or the second time i have been disappointed by bodega","definitely not worth the price","love my veggie sandwich","consistently good","ordered the nachos to split","enough to feed two hungry bellies and unbelievably tasty","not much room to sit though especially on

but i am very disappointed and disgusted by the customer service that i received","1 delivery was not on time and i stay walking distance from the business","2 i ordered macadamia nut and he brought chocolate chip cookies","instead of calling and informing me before taking it upon himself to choose for me","3 when he finally got to me he basically tried to demand a tip remind you i already had tip in cash in my pocket without giving me a chance to reach inmy pocket","instead he stated that if the customer does tip on card they look forward to tip in cash since they deliver on a bike","then he went to say so we ca deliver to you any longer if you ca tip ","then walked off","4 usually when you pay with card you have to sign a credit card copy saying you received your delivery and so forth but he was so rude he forgot to give me my copy or have me sign","with that being said i called the business to speak with the manager to inform him about this bad service and the man in the phone said the manager store owner was in at the moment and he could do anything to help but ta!e my name and number so i am waiting for this call because this was my 1st and last time spending my hard earned coins with this business and i still have touched the food and i will not dare","if the manager ca understand my concern and take action then i will take matters into my own hands legally and

5 and change to get a taco and empanada which was plenty","this place is great","cool atmosphere and excellent food and very inexpensive","it seems like more of an authentic cuisine than most tex mex fare and i really like their seasonings","it would be nice if they served a beverage that was sugar free and caffeine free","and it would be nice if they used a microphone and pa to announce orders","as it is they yell out when orders are ready and i almost impossible to hear","unfortunately our experience at crazy taco was just just that crazy","three of us came for lunch on a friday","it was crowded and appeared pretty clean","we got complimentary chips and salsa and waited about 20 30 mins for our food","i ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp corn tacos which were very flavorful","another friend ordered in spanish a chicken burrito without rice but what she received had plenty of rice","she ended up ordering another one without rice and taking the wrong one to go","they also forgot to put beans on the side but corrected it when she pointed it out","the other friend ordered a quesadilla and she enjoyed it","some other things were off as well when it came to getting that burrito order right but the craziness really happened when the bill came","for some reason and the two women were never able to explain the tax there was 15 ","now we did use a coupon so maybe this was their way of recouping the lost revenue but in the end they did get a tip and got exactly what was due for what w bought","they also only wanted cash but i pointed out to them that the only put up the sign after we sat down but my friend went to withdraw money for them","the food was good but the dishonesty is grounds for being reported to the bbb","new ownership and this place is

here we have loved everything about it","the atmosphere the food the service","i all great","great outside seating with a lawn games area","fun spot","the food was actually really good but after

very good","house salad is great","good beer selection","nice atmosphere","service was very good","first off the food is pretty good","even the service waitress was pretty good","but when it came time to close out the check it all went down hill","details aside their table side card reader did not work","the gm came to our table and proceeded in speaking to us like we could not afford the meal","he spoke rudely to my wife out of the gate and ultimately said he did not want our future business ","nowhere in the world of professionalism should that statement come out of the mouth of one running a restaurant","so if yoe willing to roll the service dice to get a high priced small portion meal which we were and credit to the chef it was good then maybe this place is for you but we will never be back","a lot of people will say this place is overpriced and that the proportions are way too small","i would tend to agree but i would add that if they can just get that figured out it has potential","the flavors were bad and some were quite good","i actually found one of my orders to be way too big in proportion the porkbelly was huge and did seem cooked correctly","not that it was

not the best","not spicy enough and not as flavorful as other ramen e had","i believe it cost 13 14","the portion was large and they give you a lot of toppings that other ramen places do","cut the store some slack","the crew only trained for 3 days","i guarantee they are much better than what anyone has experienced before","posting to give my take of the tonkotsu ramen as someone who has visited japan and eaten a lot of it there","i finally went to yama izakaya yesterday because i had heard they had authentic ramen","e been disappointed by many other restaurants who make the claim but have terrible ramen","authentic tonkotsu ramen is one of the best foods e ever eaten","i the japanese comfort food equivalent of the cheeseburger to an american","recommend anyone to try it","back to yam tonkotsu pork ramen","overall give it an 80 85 grade relative to ramen you would get in tokyo or a city with a large japanese population like la or seattle","it was solid ramen although it did blow me away in the same way that it did in japan","the flavor was there the ingredients were all there and were all done well","personally prefer the broth to be creamier though","but different places make it differently","i even experienced this in japan","that each restaurant made it a little different sometimes more watery sometimes thicker","l probably go back to have it again sometime","glad somewhere in charlotte actually does it reasonably well","my only major drawback on it is that i pretty dang expensive","i remember going to la to have ramen or even in tokyo and the price was around 8 10 tops","i think it was about 13 for the ramen without adding anything in addition although it comes how you would expect it but you can add more pork etc ","if the ramen was 8

polite nice service but food was not worthy of a restaurant","my wife and i chose this place based on reviews here and yelp and they were on point","we had a 6 30pm reservation on a saturday night","we were a few minutes early but were seated immediately","i had the blackened heart of ribeye topped with herb blue cheese butter","on the side were fingerling potatoes cooked in duck fat and asparagus","it was out of this world and the potatoes were off the chain","my wife had just for the halibut","the halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers spinach and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc","she loved it although her spinach was a bit sandy","we did have room for desert but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake","also off the chain","i am typically a fan of dense cheesecake","this is not but the flavor was amazing","the guy who usually works the register along with a few other guys is the rudest and most unprofessional group of young guys working anywhere","of course chipotle food is awesome but these guys who think theyre having these inside jokes in front of customers are just beyond annoying","the

started to eat my burger","after the first bite i could tell it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done","all i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it","all and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut

south blvd","a hispanic male employee about 5 11 or 6 feet with facial hair and a beard with chestnut colored skin took my order","the first thing i had asked the employee that represented this subway store was if i could get a foot long with two different types of bread","his reply was yes","we proceeded to the next step which was building my sandwich","upon my request of condiments i asked if he could drizzle it across zig zag","he squeezed a glob of it on one side of my bread","i simply excused him for making this error","after the last step of him making my sandwich he turns it over to the young black male","the young black male was in the process of checking me out when he noticed i had a subway offer","the hispanic male comes over and says you have to present this before ordering","i said okay and explained to him this was the first time me hearing this at a subway","i had no problems but i wanted to let him know that this subway operated differently from the rest","the subway offer was any foot long for 6","00","the hispanic male told me that he was going to charge me extra for using two different pieces of bread","i had asked him before we even started to build my sandwich if i could use two different types","he did not tell me that it would be extra for the bread his only response was yes you can use two different types of bread","if i knew that then i would have ordered that","he rung up something on the cash register and my total came out to be 15 dollars and some change","i explained to him sir i am trying to use my coupon offer can you make my sandwich over again if i going to be this much","he refused to make it over and said that i had to buy it at 15 dollars and that the sandwich will be thrown away was his excuse reason","i have been going to subway for the past 2 years and i have gone enough to know how subway operates","i am displeased in the service of that franchise business","i should have to pay that much for a foot long

busy","customers come before anything","i will not be going to that subway again and not any other subwa","he wanted me to leave the store and that was his way of doing it","it sad when you have a

lady at a table by herself then 4 people at the bar","we got a beer and a sweet tea pretty fast but waited 30 minutes and watched the 1 waitress on duty get fussed at by several customers for waiting

salad dressing","this is exactly the type of service i received at uncle maddi in overstreet mall and it makes such a difference","i do post reviews often hardly at all but i felt compelled to share this story","alberto you and your staff are awesome","thank you for taking such good care of your customers","i actually do love chain restaurants or fast casual in general but you can bet my husband and i will be regulars at uncle maddi on kings","the staff was great happy and helpful","the pizza was okay","i prefer portofinos or brixx","i so hot out and the restaurant was just as hot inside","the entrance exit door is in the middle of the diningroom and as many patrons left they held the door open and let any cool air out","as i was eating i noticed several gnats fruit flies flying around which was very appetizing","i used the restroom before i left and there were too many gnats fruit flies in there","i wo be back","taco tuesday is great","quality tacos for 2","decent sized margaritas 4","50","able to fill your boots for two people for 20 odd tip","only thing is more servers would be preferable","e found a new place to dine","this pizza with have your taste buds cutting flips","i got the meat lovers this time still wanna try at least four other choices not to mention building my own pizza one day","this is the best mexican restaurant in charlotte","people here do not appreciate the restaurants they have","what winston salem and greensboro has to offer ai sh t compared to places in charlotte","i have visited this restaurant more than one occasion every time i come to charlotte and always have a great experience with amazing food","i have eaten at blaze pizza ever but not a big fan of creating my own pizza like a subway","i like the normal cheese pizza and oddly enough they had that on the menu","the pizza was made in probably like 1 minute and 30 seconds from start to finish","the pizza tasted great and i would eat at blaze pizza if i ever need a quick lunch but the whole normal pizza is still a little bit better because it has more cheese once you bite down","do get me wrong the pizza is really good but the customer service is a reason in itself to go","since i work in customer service too i always notice and appreciate a 5 star experience","have you ever went to get lunch and you were served by someone who obviously really really really hates their job","i a little disheartening is it","well not here","every employee is smiling and having fun","they all seem to care about their job","they also use your name at every point of the pizza making process","this is not something you see at similar places like chipotle or mo etc","these guys obviously have a great manager who encourages their awesome attitudes","also they have this really good orange lemonade","just try it"]
