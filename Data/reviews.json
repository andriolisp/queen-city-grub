Toilet was super loud, woke up to hearing others flush toilet in the morning next room over, shower was hard to turn on without getting wet, and there was no conservation of water/energy.\nOn the plus side everyone was kind and courteous, clean, safe, and decent views.\nLocation in proximity to things was really good too."

When I shopped at Northlake, it remember it having a Belk, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Macy's. Let me just say that the Macy's was a really clean store. Plenty of good clothing selection. Along with this, the mall's food court also had a diverse selection. The pizza spot there was very savory.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to shop. They had a Sweet Spot store inside which I of course got a lot of candy. They also had a Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, and an AMC. Very enjoyable mall. \n\n- Bryce B."

The bartender served my martini in an old fashion glass with ice. The dining tables were dirty and sticky. Shipping tape held my drapery liner together.  Stains on the carpet in room #525.  My worst stay in a Marriott in 25 years."

        "Review": "I am extremely disappointed with this hotel. I don't complain about services too much, because I'm pretty lenient and understanding and an overall positive person. But the Charlotte Marriott City Center gets 2 HUGE strikes right now. Never again. I've been here twice and both experiences have been very negative. \n\nOne...the 'mobile key' app they so-hyped since I checked in is glitchy and not ready for prime time. I spent about 5 minutes standing at my door trying to get it to open my door to no avail. I got a message on my phone saying go to the front desk to get a physical key. Their explanation? 'Oh, sometimes it's a little iffy'. You know what? Don't promote it and hype it until it is solidly working. Having worked in IT and dealing with mobile apps...terrible execution. \n\nTwo...I don't like housekeeping in my room, due to past bad experiences. I always put the 'Do not disturb' sign on, and someone from the hotel even saw me put it up this morning and acknowledged it. In my 18 years of reserving rooms myself, I've never had anyone come into my room after putting the sign on, in any type of hotel. But it happened today. Now I don't know who took the sign off, but someone did and all my stuff is now rearranged and I am not happy. So Marriott...it's on you or your clientele."

Ate at the Auntie Annies with Cinnabon, good eat. The tables we sat at across from them however were a it gross, sticky surfaces and crumbs but that's mall seating not specifically theirs. Small food court but they had a Taco Bell and Sbarro in there. 2 level mall, easily walked from end to end in under an hour if you don't go I'm any stores. It was air conditioned and overall clean. I would visit here again when in the area."

        "Review": "Northlake Mall has to make a choice, and make it now:  The Investors who own the mall have allowed the management company to condone an atmosphere of rampant under 20 year-olds who are disrespectful, loud and threatening to anyone who isn't a part of their crowd.  On Friday and Saturday evenings, the mall's main entrance closest to the AMC Theatre becomes an outdoor gang recruitment center complete with cars playing music so loud you can't hear yourself think.\nThis 'scene' has led to two separate shooting incidents in the last two years - though not on weekend nights.  This past Christmas one of those incidents involved a shootout with a Charlotte Police Officer who killed the thug.\n \nThe variety of stores is still good, although there have been several stores that left.  Johnston & Murphy Men's Shoes, a high end store, closed, Italian restaurant BRAVO Cucina Italiana closed, among others."

Ordered Verde Veggie burrito w/Napolito salad and ate on patio on a very hot day. They bring table nachos w/a uniquely hearty corn salsa that tastes pretty good. PROS - Food was VERY fresh and very flavorful; server was EXTREMELY friendly; reggae tunes were mellow and set the beachfront Caribbean atmosphere; & despite 90\u00b0+ temps the patio somehow attracted a nice breeze. CONS (for me) - very old, grubby looking vintage walls, floor, & decor; and indoor seating tables are very close to each other."

        "Review": "Not the best. \n\nI would complain about the wait times but 'the dumplings are made to order!' and I was with a large group. The dumplings were delicious but I wish they had placed a few more on the plate. My entree came with the sushi roll we ordered and I felt like they didn't give me a proper portion. The rest of my friends had plenty of food filling their bowls, which were huge by the way. Who ever designed the menu really likes pineapple because almost every other item had pineapple in it. The sushi just didn't pan out like I was expecting it to. I know when dining in any city like Charlotte, food is going to be marked up. But, when that's the case, at least put some effort into it. The rice was too dry, and the vegetables in it were lacking their natural juices as well leaving the entire roll flavorless. Presentation was okay. It kinda looked like someone was in a rush when plating the sushi. Honestly you'd save more money and time going to Harris Teeter and grabbing some sushi and a bottle of wine. \n\nTL:DR\nSushi is better elsewhere and it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nAnd for God's sake, please get a new DJ. So many lame remixes of current pop songs set to an 80's bass track"

The Halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers, spinach, and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc.\n\nShe loved it, although her spinach was a bit sandy. \n\nWe didn't have room for desert, but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake.

The entrees: poor quality meat, over seasoned and undercooked. One of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order. The waiter barely graced our presence, never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated. After we ordered the lemon cake , he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill. Just a note on your signature dessert- stale, hard and crusty...at least a few days old. We did speak to the manager about the terrible experience. He quickly became defensive, perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed."

My salad came with  lettuce, croutons and salmon. At least it was fresh I probably wound't bother to make the comment. I will not order from this place in the future. This is the 1st time I am ordering from Jason's Deli at Pineville location in NC."

The place had a number of tables and most were empty. I was long after the lunch hour. The staff were very nice,  but I wasn't expecting my food to take as long as it did. Maybe 8-10 minutes. I'm okay with this kind of wait but my preconceived notion was to expect a Panara sub 5 minute meal. Definitely worth it and didn't subtract from my experience.  I wish that there were locations in my part of the country as I would definitely eat at them."

Our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we're crazy and told US that the table was clean. We had to ask 3 times for them to clean, but it was only grudgingly. Our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum. For some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3' straw thin  French fries it was not worth the time nor the money. \nPutting up with it due to the inclement weather, we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house. This of course, infuriated us more. How a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me."

I felt because i am not a regular they just sort of ignored me. I ordered  my burger med rare.  At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it. All and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut\u00e9ed spinach was good"

The food was not good for the price, the chicken salad was boring, the bread was old and stale. The sweet potato mash was watery, stringy and bland. If this restaurant was not a 501C3 designation I would have refused to pay the food was that bad. I don't know if it because I'm a single woman I got treated so badly or what.

Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.\n\nThe two word review:  Why Bother?"

The hostess was very polite.  She told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time.  Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.  I would never leave no tip even with horrible service.  I am very disappointed.  I know $9 is not a lot of money to some but again I did NOT authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill."

I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffl\u00e9 so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else.

The waitress told us the specials, but when we went to order, found out that 1/3 of the menu was not available because they were out. She did not offer substitutions or other options, which we heard her give other guests. The food was barely average, and the grits notably came out barely warm.

        "Review": "This review relates only to the Annual Oyster Feast.  We attended the 3rd annual one on October 2nd, 2014.\n\nPrice per head was $95.  Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.\n\nThe oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.\n\nOther selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)\n\nAfter about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.\n\nOverall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."

I just love that Ruby Tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce!  :)   They seated all 8 of us pretty quickly, service was good, and the food was consistent.\nPositives: Pretty good salad bar (they have spinach!), healthy side choices, consistently good food.\nNegatives: They were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky."

Specials most days of the week, and routinely there are special tappings or events with rare beers. If you like beer, and are in the University area, this should be your place to go.\n\nCome find me there. I'm the loud, bald, fat man there on Monday nights. Let's have a beer."

It was the most pathetic steak I have ever been served.  So, I broke two life records today.  Longest wait for a meal and worst steak ever.  $40.  I will be getting the ravioli to go for my wife (calling it in at least an hour early) but will never sit down at that place again.  0 stars for me but plus 2 on behalf of my wife."

Throughout my night there, in excess of thirty women were up on top of the speakers on the dancefloor dancing, which was absolutely fine and accepted by all staff. However, when a male friend of mine got up to dance he was told to get down and leave the venue. A huge double standard and very sexist. When another friend tried to peacefully reason with the secuirty staff, simplyto keep our friend in the venue he was suddenly, without warning put into a full headlock by the 230 pound staff member. So here we have a placid, peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled, rammed head first into the floor, laid on top of, once again with hugely excessive force. The whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance. He was then picked up by a second security staff, the two thugs combining to ram his head into a pillar as he was removed from the premises, comolete with a split head and very very confused to what had happened. Disgraceful security, and the manager when asked to be spoken to was not interested at all, obviously supporting thuggery more than friendly business. Huge regrets for spending any of my hard earned money here."

Neither are what I consider dinner atmosphere. The menu is such a hodgepodge of food. We thought with the name 'Lure' we were going to have a great seafood selection, we were wrong. The Blue Point oysters we ordered were mushy. Hard pass. And the calamari were boring and cold. Pass on these, too. And that's when we decided we should just cut our losses and head somewhere else. The wait staff is nice and helpful. Bless their hearts.  \n\nIn short, are they a seafood resturant? A diner? A pool hall? A club? I'm not sure and don't think I will be back to find out."

The Asiago crab dip was a great recommendation as well as the carrot cake for desert. Great suggestive selling. Our entrees were out in less than twenty minutes. We even had a couple of managers stop in periodically to check on us. I think their names were Nick and Kevin. Great guys. I am a mystery shopper by trade and always take notes on my visits.

I want to walk away from that feeling like 'That was incredible and I can't wait to go again'. That is not even close to what we felt. We got the 'newbie' waiter, so the service was not top notch. We were told the special came with a white wine sauce, only to overhear another waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce. Sure enough, it came out with a red sauce. If the price of the meal was in the $60 range I might not be so critical. But when you pay what I consider to be a pretty pricey cost...add to that the fact that the $9 glass of wine came from an $8 bottle (it was good wine, but I don't need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction), I would say it was just 'ok'. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth going back to when there are so many other great places in the area."

He said they are not NUTs they are pumpkin nuts. While eating my salad my mouth started burning. I was having an allergic reaction. I didn't know why. I asked my husband to google pesto. Pesto has PINE NUTS in them. We told Jordan and he said that pesto at Bonefish Grill does not have NUT. I then asked for hot tea. My allergic reaction made me nauseated so I rushed home. When I googles Bonefish Pesto this morning this I what I found \n\n1 cup basil leaves\n1/4 cup Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup PINE NUTS\n2 garlic cloves, chopped\n1/4 tsp salt\n6 Kalamata olives\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nI think servers should be knowledgeable about the items they are serving.

I'm the manager at Tint W*[%* and know how reviews can affect a business and how there's some ppl out there you just can't please so all I'm saying is give the place a try, I'm sure you'll love it...and make sure you try the bang bang shrimp."

With that said, the ribs are the best. I can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all. Why? Well it's not because I'm a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite. 5'9, 150. It's because the ribs are so good that I am not even thinking about how full I am. The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is insane. And throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and I am happier than a pig in... Do yourself a favor and get the ribs!! On a side note, my wife last year ordered the catch of the day and she said it was good. Now she only gets the ribs. Nice servers and a nice looking, clean place too."

The waiter said he will take care of it.    \nI waited while others finish eating.  He brought the check and my dish was canceled. so I did not get anything to eat.\nAnother person's order  has wing in his dish, it was way too salty too.

We waited outside because it was standing room only. 70 minutes later I returned to the hostess stand and noted there was NO ONE waiting other than us. The Hostess was dumbstruck when I asked how much longer. She said there were no guests waiting/unseated. She asked me 3 times for my name and number in my party. She finally told me to go into the bar and she would find a server. I'll quickly bullet the rest on the evening:\n- not given water after asking\n- received drinks 20 minutes after ordering\n- 1 refill required extreme effort and 1 hour\n- food was cafeteria quality\n- server was superficially smiling but obviously perturbed\n- drunk panhandler was greeted by the barmaid by name. Larry then proceeded to ask table after table of diners for gas money. 4th table complained to the barmaid who finally asked Larry to leave.\n- salad refill never arrived.\n\nPreviously 3 stars:\nAsk for Server Lynette. She's the best!\nAvoid the Talapia. I suspect seafood ain't generally their strong suit"

I had water and my cup was refilled ONCE durning the entire hour and a half i was there( yes my cup was EMPTY), my boys didn't get a refill until after me. After our waitress came to the table ONCE to apologize for the long wait between ordering drinks and appitizers then our food i finally asked her was there a reason our table was getting such poor service? her response to me was ' im sorry i had other tables and i had to close a big group out' i asked for the manager and explained to him the issue and he had no response or an apology!!! oh but he comped my appitizers all of ten dollars on an 80.00 BILL!!!!!!!!!!

They just melt in your mouth and are so simple but have so much in depth flavor. All the other food is great as well and it's a  great place to try new dishes including fried chicken skin nachos, rocky mountain oysters, etc. The drinks are phenomenal as well, especially their Moscow mule. Warning though, if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait up to an hour, possibly two, for a table inside. I will say though, it's more than worth the wait."

The place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters, exposed brick walls, eclectic light fixtures, and a peacock over the sushi bar. It is a bit loud, but the DJ spun music is good.\n\nThe food is a great collection of modern interpretations of regional classics in small plates to share. There are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine (but I didn't have enough room to sample). With all of this, there are also simple kebab options, and dip options. Then there's the sushi bar and menu. Yes, eclectic. But tasty and done well.\n\nCoctails are good, wine list is good, and the beer list seemed a bit short, but with more than enough liquors to make up for it. Probably the best bourbon list I've seen since we left Kentucky!"

It doesn't seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest/customer even when it's not busy. It also doesn't have the 'sanitary' feel to it (sanitary grade 96.0). I noticed that not all the staff wear gloves/hair net/hat when handling food. Food it self doesn't look/taste fresh. I had the Noda salad for lunch and it tasted like it's been out all day. Great location - It seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee. However, based on my experience, I wouldn't order anything simply because I wouldn't wanna get sick. It's kinda like waffle house...if that makes any sense."

Great breakfast all day items and I love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items. Love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly. Service and professionalism need improvement. \n\nOn a recent visit, we sat outside (brought the dog; bad idea; July heat) and waited 5-10 minutes before receiving water (repeat... July heat) or menus. Not a great start...but OK. We then proceeded to sit for another 50 minutes before receiving our food.  \n\nThough the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant, the kitchen performance was also spotty...  Parts of the meal were freshly made; other items (ie biscuits and gravy) had heavily congealed; revealing it had sat ready for SOME TIME before it was served. Lines happen and kitchens get backed up; this is not the issue. I will wait for good food; just don't make me wait and then serve bad food.\n \nThe server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server. Perhaps something to be dealt with behind closed doors?"

The drinks themselves could be served better.  \n\nNow I'm not one to be a drink sob, when you wanna get a good buzz on, then serve is however you can.  But when you ask for a Jager Bomb or an Irish Car Bomb, then I think their  respective shots should drop/bomb into the drink.  In theory, that would happen if the shot was in..say...a shot glass.  They served the shot is a plastic medicine cup.  That makes it difficult to drink/bomb/enjoy.  The shot was just floating in the pint glass.\n\nDoes anyone remember Exxon Valdez?  Plastic is made of oil, and oil floats.\n\nAlso, one more thing.   The music is so damn loud, that I can't hear myself think about how loud the music is.  \n\nI understand...It tries to be classy, what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels, like a posh NYC night club...but this is a bowling alley.\n\nAn Alley."

Then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time, after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost. After not checking if the keys were turned in, and initially saying 'no', he began to respond with things like, 'it's not my f***ing responsibility if you lost your keys',  'I don't have your keys you f***ing stupid b**ch,' and 'stop giving me attitude about your keys' (when she clearly wasn't). I was standing right next to her, and after repeated comments like this, I'd heard enough and said, 'hey man, the girl lost her keys, and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here, what is your problem?' He immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me 'What the f***k are you going to do about it?' (something I don't think was necessary, at all, at this point). He proceeds to call over security who says, 'Hey let's talk about this over here' (pointing to a spot away from the bar). I agreed saying, 'yes, let's talk about it' (after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt, by an overly aggressive bar tender).

Our server was M.I.A.for the majority of my time there. Beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time. Bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer. Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."

I will not come here again. Thank you and goodnight.\n\nP.S they are very sloppy"

        "Review": "To be quite honest service is poor.. \nI've attented this resturant few times. \nAt first they treated me as a costumer should be treated. It wasn't until later that i was treated very poorly. maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior i've incounter is unacceptable. I would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out. I was patient until I realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress. As a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking. (but of course thats just me) \nSecond, when my family & i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the 'kitchen was close' and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half  before closing time but even then that didn't much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it wasn't until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me .. they refuse to serve my family & i but served them no questions asked? I THINK NOT .. an apologe was not even giving to us. \nThirdly, the  DJ is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song. I as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee. As an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj .. \nThis resturant is a disappointment big time.  I would be damned if i step foot here again. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime!."

The atmosphere is warm and relaxed, the staff is friendly, and we have literally never had a bad dish in the 50+ times we've been here.  Personal favorites include the Boracha Chicken and the Shrimp Tacos.  Totally decent drink specials ($3.99 dirty Martini's!), karaoke, nice view over the little lake.  Highly recommend!!!"

        "Review": "Been waiting forever to try this place. In all honesty, I'll have to try a regular plate for a more unbiased opinion. To rate the food, it was 4/5. Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

        "Review": "Stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament.  My biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside (which I told them about several times) and the laundry/cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived (after 6pm).  In general, they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff.  But our room was clean, so that is good.  This is your typical Hyatt Place, so if you are familiar with the brand and layout, you know what to expect.  The lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast, but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful.  This hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators (which are in the hallways right behind the front desk, also used for access to/from the lobby and other rooms).   This was definitely a problem during high traffic times, you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators.  Very poor layout in my opinion.  Otherwise, the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a Hyatt Place, so if you like the layout it will be the same.   I really like the sitting area, it's quite large and has a big L-shaped sofa and a separate desk.  Really nice!   The only thing I don't like about these rooms is the 'open' bathroom area.  The sink is basically in the bedroom so it's very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready (like brushing your teeth) without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping.   But if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time, no problem.\nNegatives: Small lobby and breakfast area (cramped if busy), overflowing trash cans outside, a lot of laundry/cleaning carts in hallways, very cramped elevator location.\nPositives: Large rooms, new, modern, room was clean and quiet."

I think that this place has potential,but I think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out and the mini market.  The pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to. There was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored,but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms. That did not make a difference. The pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do."

There are plenty of television downstairs to lounge and watch. It was a great experience with kind and friendly staff."

        "Review": "First, I would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job. Lucy, is an angel. It meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea. I know grandma CAN do it herself, but we encourage her to let us help her.  For anyone that looks after someone who has needs, the little things mean the world to people who take care of them. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. \n\nHowever, Hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people. It is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people (especially at night), as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped.  Bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location.\n\nThere was some confusion or miscommunication about the room I had booked. I booked a two bed room, and what I received was a one bed room with a pull out couch. The other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed. Truth be told, I was not stoked to sleep on the floor on Friday for $140 a night. However, we were able to move rooms on Saturday. \n\nHyatt! Spend the money and supply your staff team!\n\nHotel policy's are a 'hit and miss'.  What I mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay, but be charged for it another time. \n\nThere is apparently a $30 'damage fee' to cover any hotel property if ruined.  I was not charged this fee before, so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill. However, the kind desk manager, Joel, was able to remove it. \n\nThis is my second time at this hotel, and both times I had my dog. The first time I was not charged $75 (even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file). For the record, the dog is well behaved.  When I asked the manager (name?) about it, he simply told me that it was policy. I told the manager I understood, but if there if a policy, follow through with it at all times. He removed it, but honestly, the money didn't matter. It is more important that I can be informed.  I was frustrated. I felt like I was being  'dismissed' from the conversation by having the charge dropped. I want to be informed so I am prepared for the charge on my bill. \n\nBottom line, if you have a policy, follow through with it at all times. Inconsistency kills a business. I do not like to be surprised with 'fees' I was not informed of, nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel. \n\nI don't get to see my family as often as I like since I took a job in Florida, so these trips are special to us. I chose Hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends. I chose this particular location due to other customer reviews. My first visit compared to my last visit was night and day. \n\nWhen I left, I felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel. I am a client who like to 'have it together' as far as reservations and what to expect. I set this trip up for my family, and I feel like I failed them. \n\nIt was good to see old friends and family during my visit, but the hotel was not a nice stay."

The hostess, Juliana, was very pleasant and helpful as I was traveling from Columbia for dinner. After being seated at 7:15 on Monday evening, it wasn't until 7:45 before we had our drinks. We reluctantly had to ask the hostess to put in our appetizer orders. We had the Yellowfin tuna tartare and the charcuterie board which were well balanced and flavorful. Yet, it was still a constant struggle for service. \n\nOur server got our entree orders wrong and failed to bring out our 2nd round of drinks after multiple times of us requesting them. He also didn't come see us after we received our meal so I didn't get to eat what I ordered. I had the 10oz filet with bordelaise, which had fantastic flavor and texture - the bordelaise was a perfect accompaniment. To no surprise, paying the bill was just a difficult. \n\nTo my knowledge, the restaurant was launching a new menu tonight, which, understandably, could be problematic for some servers. The problem was that we routinely saw our waiter pass us to help out the other tables around us, yet he repeatedly neglected to attend to our table. I expect more in terms of service when I pay $120 for a dinner for two. It pained me to even leave a decent tip. The food, on the contrary, was phenomenal - which is why I gave the rating 2 stars. The interior had a very upbeat and lively atmosphere."

The Wagyu steak was good, but I could do better for cheaper.  Another dish we were served was barely-cooked vegetables.  Everyone was appropriately apologetic, but due to the slow service and limited vegetable options, we had to just leave it.  My recommendation to the place?  Less expensive fancy cuts of meat and more attention to the easy details -- like cooking vegetables!\n\nIf you want to try something new in Charlotte, you might want to move this one down the list til they can sort their kitchen issues."

Good amount of crab and a great hush puppy batter with a house made tartar blend. I had the mammoth burger with everything and the house made pimento cheese. Burger was cooked excellent however I wish they had given a little more pimento. I couldn't taste the cheese on the burger.

But the Charlotte Marriott City Center gets 2 HUGE strikes right now. Never again. I've been here twice and both experiences have been very negative. \n\nOne...the 'mobile key' app they so-hyped since I checked in is glitchy and not ready for prime time. I spent about 5 minutes standing at my door trying to get it to open my door to no avail. I got a message on my phone saying go to the front desk to get a physical key. Their explanation? 'Oh, sometimes it's a little iffy'. You know what? Don't promote it and hype it until it is solidly working. Having worked in IT and dealing with mobile apps...terrible execution. \n\nTwo...I don't like housekeeping in my room, due to past bad experiences. I always put the 'Do not disturb' sign on, and someone from the hotel even saw me put it up this morning and acknowledged it. In my 18 years of reserving rooms myself, I've never had anyone come into my room after putting the sign on, in any type of hotel. But it happened today. Now I don't know who took the sign off, but someone did and all my stuff is now rearranged and I am not happy. So Marriott...it's on you or your clientele."

The bar was fine if you get a seat away from the front door. They have a neat fish tank and the bartender was attentive to drinks and food which was nice. If you like hot tea I would highly recommend getting a pot of their hot tea. It is delicious and some of the best tea I have had. I'm not a big burger fan so I've only stuck with the sushi here. They have some nice combinations and some good options if you want to stay away from anything fried (although fried anything is so good).  My favorite so far is the tropical storm roll because it comes with a decent amount of fish and a nice sauce. If you want an appetizer, the tuna-Tini is really good and is a pretty good portion.  Good food, good atmosphere."

Along with this, the mall's food court also had a diverse selection. The pizza spot there was very savory.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to shop. They had a Sweet Spot store inside which I of course got a lot of candy. They also had a Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, and an AMC. Very enjoyable mall. \n\n- Bryce B."

On Friday and Saturday evenings, the mall's main entrance closest to the AMC Theatre becomes an outdoor gang recruitment center complete with cars playing music so loud you can't hear yourself think.\nThis 'scene' has led to two separate shooting incidents in the last two years - though not on weekend nights.  This past Christmas one of those incidents involved a shootout with a Charlotte Police Officer who killed the thug.\n \nThe variety of stores is still good, although there have been several stores that left.

The rest of my friends had plenty of food filling their bowls, which were huge by the way. Who ever designed the menu really likes pineapple because almost every other item had pineapple in it. The sushi just didn't pan out like I was expecting it to. I know when dining in any city like Charlotte, food is going to be marked up. But, when that's the case, at least put some effort into it. The rice was too dry, and the vegetables in it were lacking their natural juices as well leaving the entire roll flavorless. Presentation was okay. It kinda looked like someone was in a rush when plating the sushi. Honestly you'd save more money and time going to Harris Teeter and grabbing some sushi and a bottle of wine. \n\nTL:DR\nSushi is better elsewhere and it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nAnd for God's sake, please get a new DJ.

Was a bit messy/soggy and it pretty well fell apart towards the end, but still good and worth it.\n\nThey have a really good selection of hot sauces, ranked 1-10, so grabbed a couple of small cups of them for garnish on the sandwich.\n\nWait time to get the sandwich was a little long, especially when you measure against JJ or Subway, but the wait was worth it."

Knew it would be busy but we were in no hurry and the weather was great. All was going fine until we received our food. I ordered a chicken sandwich and the presentation was nice and the fruit salad was beautiful. However the chicken was undercooked and disgusting, completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick. The texture!!! I know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it. I hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked. He looked at it and insisted it was fine, that it's how the cook it on the flat top or something like that. He did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all- just snatched my plate up and walked away. I sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes. He completely ignored me for the rest of the meal, as if I had done something wrong. I noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so I guess they figured all was settled. But I take poor service and lack of pride in serving edible meals to be a big deal.

He yelled to the kitchen he needs fries. I walked away in disbelief watching him fix the same fries . Very disappointed. The other employees seem to have been a little upset that I asked for fresh fries too. He told me his name was Gary over the phone and he was the supervisor. So distasteful !!

I'm aware it is often hard to pinpoint where this illness came from, but the fact that this is the one place my husband and I both ate at makes it clear to me. We also began feeling bad around the same time frame. I wasn't calling to receive free food (we don't live anywhere near a Jim N Nick's), we were just trying to make management aware."

I've been to quite a few....But I've never tasted BBQ like this ever before in my life. Jim and Nicks was introduced to me last December. They catered our Christmas Employee Appreciation Dinner. I was sold. Shortly afterwards, I visited the restaurant to try other food items. I have yet to be disappointed. Everyone there is always friendly. I LOVE JIM AND NICKS! I wish there was one closer to home. But it's always a treat to have that smoked tender BBQ. And the Mac and Cheese is to die for.

I visited Chima last week with some friends and I would say that if you are hungry for some good food and enjoy good customer service then you should visit them soon. The experience was good from the moment you walk into their beautiful establishment. Greeted with warm smiles and hostesses eager to take care of your needs. The mood is nice with the dimmed lights and soft music. The service is good. No waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress. Orders are there in a timely manner, and table is cleared almost instantly. The meat is circulating around like clockwork and is always hot and juicy with flavors that melt in your mouth. Their salad bar features many different options of salads from Mixed Greens to Pasta salads. It also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice. At the table, they bring many different side dishes, which is something I haven't experienced at a Brazilian Steak House before. Even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one. I did however, had an issue with the valet parking I didn't get as stated on their website(update site with start time). My waitress did send a manager my way, he explained the rule(law) that the states has about valet parking(knowledge) and even offered to split the cost for the parking deck payment. I was all smiles after that. I left Chima  happy, stuff and could barely walk but satisfied with the outcome overall. Chima, you will see me again. Thank you for a wonderful evening.By the way, try the Brazilian soda called Guarana Antarctica...SO GOOD"

Try as many as you like or as few as you like, however I recommend trying as many as you can.

On the side were fingerling potatoes (cooked in duck fat) and asparagus. It was out of this world, and the potatoes were off the chain!\n\nMy wife had Just for the Halibut. The Halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers, spinach, and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc.\n\nShe loved it, although her spinach was a bit sandy. \n\nWe didn't have room for desert, but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake.

We met with the event coordinator, Kay Emad, and squared away all details for the day. Kay assured me that every detail we discussed would be met on the day of. When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve."

The entrees: poor quality meat, over seasoned and undercooked. One of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order. The waiter barely graced our presence, never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated. After we ordered the lemon cake , he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill. Just a note on your signature dessert- stale, hard and crusty...at least a few days old. We did speak to the manager about the terrible experience. He quickly became defensive, perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed."

Management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not 'being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities'. I was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an 'activity'. This should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas.

My salad came with  lettuce, croutons and salmon. At least it was fresh I probably wound't bother to make the comment. I will not order from this place in the future.

The place had a number of tables and most were empty. I was long after the lunch hour. The staff were very nice,  but I wasn't expecting my food to take as long as it did. Maybe 8-10 minutes. I'm okay with this kind of wait but my preconceived notion was to expect a Panara sub 5 minute meal. Definitely worth it and didn't subtract from my experience.  I wish that there were locations in my part of the country as I would definitely eat at them."

Second shift was the absolute worse. We were always busy but our greedy managers had us low on staff. None of the employees were valued therefore no one saw value in their job. As a waitress you get paid $2.13 hourly. The tips were okay but it just didn't seem worth it when your managers don't schedule a person to do dishes, shakes etc. all night and expect you to work overtime with out being paid!!! I go to college for a reason and it's so I NEVER have to work in an environment like this, just TERRIBLE!!\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29"

The atmosphere is fancy enough that you can impress a date but casual enough that you two won't feel out of place if you come in jeans and use a salad fork for your entree.\n\nThere isn't one mean server in the house. They are all friendly (Robbie is the best!) and I'm always impressed with how well they know the menu. I'm not a huge drinker so I'm always ordering virgin drinks. I've never had a non alcoholic drink that didn't taste like a cool spring breeze lol (Rachel is the bartender I like). \n\n You don't wait long for food, it comes out exactly when it should. Speaking of food, I rate it a ten. \n\nTop 3 Apps\n- Aria Caesar Salad (keep the anchovies, I promise they work really well with it. I used to be a no anchovies kinda girl too)\n- Gnocchi (the appetizer, I haven't tried the spinach gnocchi entree yet)\n- SHAVED KALE SALAD!!! PERFECTOOOOO!!\n\nTop 3 Entrees\n- Spaghetti and Meatballs\n- The steak is awesome, if you have a little money to blow.\n- FETTUCCINE CARBONARA! add blackened shrimp and thank Robbie for the bomb suggestion.\n\nBest dessert award goes to the Blackberry Cheesecake! Hands down! \n\nMake sure you get a cappuccino and ask Dennis (the hottest guy ever) for some whipped cream. Thank me later ladies. :)\n\nBottom line, Aria rocks! Great food, great music, and the greatest service ever. Make a reservation if you can because they do fill up fast some nights, even though I never make one and always get a table (but it's purely good luck). Make sure you try the bread, cause Lorrrrdddddd it's the best."

This is one of those restaurants, tucked in to a small unit in a shoping center, that only locals know about. I only found out about it because a now-ex used to work there, and now I tell everyone I can.\n\nThere's apparently other items on the menu than sushi, or so I've been told. If that matters to you."

Our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we're crazy and told US that the table was clean. We had to ask 3 times for them to clean, but it was only grudgingly. Our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum. For some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3' straw thin  French fries it was not worth the time nor the money. \nPutting up with it due to the inclement weather, we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house. This of course, infuriated us more. How a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me."

At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it. All and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut\u00e9ed spinach was good"

The week before that I was in around 6pm and ordered Salmon and the middle was raw, raw. I was eating at the Lucky Texan about 3 times every two weeks. I have now switched to Outback on Independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks. Steaks excellent , service good. John, owner of TRH should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge match. Owner should be a little more humble and not act like the customer in the wrong. He never apologized to me so I took it that he did not care if I came back.

The food was not good for the price, the chicken salad was boring, the bread was old and stale. The sweet potato mash was watery, stringy and bland. If this restaurant was not a 501C3 designation I would have refused to pay the food was that bad. I don't know if it because I'm a single woman I got treated so badly or what.

(Jasmine) This time she had no problem talking to me when i said i wanted to cancel my order. 'OK! Its canceled.' and that was it. \n\nRe ordered from dominos at 10:05 and they are going to have it here almost a full hour before pizza hut planned to. \n\nP.S. I never leave a review for anything. \nDominoes > Pizza Hut. \n\nAdditional: The dominos delivery driver recieved the $15.73 in tip i was trying to spend at this store. Excellent service from those guys. Y'all need to go take notes."

As you walk in you are expecting a server to come and sit you down because of the linen tables, no one come we stood there for about 10 mins, the cashiers were behind the counter and didn't acknowledge us. (this is the first time we came to this place) We looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order, when our food came out she didn't bring out the fries we had ordered (which you have to pay 1.99 extra for) we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we weren't getting them. We started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way, the plantains weren't cooked either and the rice was COLD. It was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us, because they were closing, as I was filling up my drink I noticed that they were just re-heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator. NASTY! The food is not fresh and not even cooked all the way and they just re-heat everything. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE!"

However, the fiery wontons were good (though pricey at $7 for 6), and our server Moua was great.  Go for the ambiance but not if you actually want any Asian flavors."

The waitress is very rude and didn't bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert, she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she didn't bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed(BTW we were at PF Chang's from 8:45 PM) and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that I have never seen someone talk to a customer. This was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like PF Chang's.\nI would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever.\nI would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us."

The hostess was very polite.  She told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time.  Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.  I would never leave no tip even with horrible service.  I am very disappointed.  I know $9 is not a lot of money to some but again I did NOT authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill."

Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.\n\nThe two word review:  Why Bother?"

This location (as well as the location in CMC/Levine hospital down the street) apparently are needing some training as well as system updates, maybe? I placed an order online for rapid pick-up. It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told 'We're out of that souffl\u00e9. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.' I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffl\u00e9 so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund.

The grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges. If that wasn't bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate. It was so overbearing I couldn't taste the potatoes or the collards. I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that I wanted and i said no just take it off the bill. Now since this restaurant is listed as an 'upscale' restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was. Well I guess not as no one came so i guess they don't really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket. We also had a 'cup' which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp & lobster bisque and there wasn't a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty. We paid the bill but since they don't seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again. on the way home I was reading their reviews and wished that I had done that before going as there were many bad reviews.\n\nVisited January 2016"

The shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall. We ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash. The server argued and said the Chef said it had lobster. Fyi my family is from Maine and knew there was no lobster. The crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought. When we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold. The peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream.  This experience embarrassed me for having to bring my family and friends to such a low level high priced dinner.  Never again."

The waitress told us the specials, but when we went to order, found out that 1/3 of the menu was not available because they were out. She did not offer substitutions or other options, which we heard her give other guests. The food was barely average, and the grits notably came out barely warm.

Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

Needless to say, nothing is consistent at this place and it is unfortunate because a movie helped guarantee its success so what's the excuse? If you want a quick place to eat with mediocre food and service, by all means, try this place out."

I spent many nights drinking shots and delicious concoctions in this place. It always reminded me of New York Pubs (especially in the winter). The food was always top notch and the best pub food money could buy. When I think of Charlotte epic restaurants, I think of Al Mike's, Gus' Sir Beef, South 21, The Penguin, The Diamond, The Knife and Fork, The Coffee Cup, The Liberty, Holly Farms, The Barclay, The Cajun Queen, Catherine's, Fenwick's, The Laurel Market, Hotel Charlotte, Red Rocks, Open Kitchen, and the list goes on....."

        "Review": "Very underwhelming. For the price of the Mother's Day brunch, the quality was extremely poor. Hash browns were burnt and tasted stale. Prime rib was medium rare but still tougher than a $2 steak. Oysters you could tell were frozen and were extremely slimy. I'm in the business so I understand the concept of trying to maximize profit, but this was just a rip off. $40 and $20 for kids i was expecting much much better. We will never return and I would give 0 stars if possible"

        "Review": "This review relates only to the Annual Oyster Feast.  We attended the 3rd annual one on October 2nd, 2014.\n\nPrice per head was $95.  Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.\n\nThe oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.\n\nOther selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)\n\nAfter about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.\n\nOverall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."

        "Review": "Worst Mexican food I've ever eaten, so bland and flavorless. Dried out chicken, what a waste of $30. Food was not good and service was poor at best. My wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it. The waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay. She replied that it wasn't to her liking that it was very dry, bland and not very good at all. The waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes. He removed the dish from the table. He didn't even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal. We will never eat at this restaurant ever again. My advice would be to look elsewhere for Mexican food. There's much friendly and delicious Mexican restaurants out there."

I love the salad bar and sides, which is why I go.  The food is consistenly pretty good (for a chain), and they have healthy options between the salad bar and vegetable sides (steamed brocolli, summer vegetables, etc....).   I just love that Ruby Tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce!  :)   They seated all 8 of us pretty quickly, service was good, and the food was consistent.\nPositives: Pretty good salad bar (they have spinach!), healthy side choices, consistently good food.\nNegatives: They were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky."

When did she think it would be cloudy? Lol. Anyways I told her no thank you, I will come back when it's cloudy. I was not impressed.

        "Review": "This is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached, not a brewery. If you're trying to eat here on a budget... don't. That's the best advice, I suppose.\n\nAim away from peak hours, for better service, and I personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles, especially for the price - I'm not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up Fried Chicken, but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing, and the waffle was nothing special. To make matters worse, it was served vertically, on a spike, without any clear way to approach it.\n\nI'm rambling. My general view of the menu is that it's focusing too much on being gourmet, and not enough on being... well, GOOD. Another reviewer got it spot-on - the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas.\n\nGreat and (slowly) rotating selection of Belgian and farmhouse style beers, one of the better places for the style in Charlotte if that's what you're into (which is what earns it the third star), but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd that's used to the city's higher-end dining and nightlife. If you've got money to burn on food or mixed drinks, or you're just here for the beer, you could do worse than a night at Heist."

Specials most days of the week, and routinely there are special tappings or events with rare beers. If you like beer, and are in the University area, this should be your place to go.\n\nCome find me there. I'm the loud, bald, fat man there on Monday nights. Let's have a beer."

FIRST,  the seating is horrible  we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because CHEDDARS doesn't have enough seating for large parties. I called to make reservations, CHEDDARS doesn't do reservations. Not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different  sections is oblivious. I'M SURE THIS LOCATION LOSES OUT ON A LOT OF MONEY BEHIND THIS VERY REASON. DO BETTER CHEDDARS. I WILL NEVER BRING MY FAMILY TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude26"

Service was okay and my wife enjoyed the ravioli but my steak was bad.  You can get a decent sirloin from anywhere and for an equal or better price.  It was the most pathetic steak I have ever been served.  So, I broke two life records today.  Longest wait for a meal and worst steak ever.  $40.  I will be getting the ravioli to go for my wife (calling it in at least an hour early) but will never sit down at that place again.  0 stars for me but plus 2 on behalf of my wife."

Throughout my night there, in excess of thirty women were up on top of the speakers on the dancefloor dancing, which was absolutely fine and accepted by all staff. However, when a male friend of mine got up to dance he was told to get down and leave the venue. A huge double standard and very sexist. When another friend tried to peacefully reason with the secuirty staff, simplyto keep our friend in the venue he was suddenly, without warning put into a full headlock by the 230 pound staff member. So here we have a placid, peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled, rammed head first into the floor, laid on top of, once again with hugely excessive force. The whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance. He was then picked up by a second security staff, the two thugs combining to ram his head into a pillar as he was removed from the premises, comolete with a split head and very very confused to what had happened. Disgraceful security, and the manager when asked to be spoken to was not interested at all, obviously supporting thuggery more than friendly business. Huge regrets for spending any of my hard earned money here."

Nice relaxed atmosphere. Good beer selection, with an emphasis on the locals; the cocktails we tried were also very good. The food here is tapas-style, so my wife and I split 5 plates which were all amazing and more than enough. Shout-out to our bartender, Wolf(w\u00fclf?), who made this a 5-star experience.

Neither are what I consider dinner atmosphere. The menu is such a hodgepodge of food. We thought with the name 'Lure' we were going to have a great seafood selection, we were wrong. The Blue Point oysters we ordered were mushy. Hard pass. And the calamari were boring and cold. Pass on these, too. And that's when we decided we should just cut our losses and head somewhere else. The wait staff is nice and helpful. Bless their hearts.  \n\nIn short, are they a seafood resturant? A diner? A pool hall? A club? I'm not sure and don't think I will be back to find out."

He went over the beer sheets and the fact that Rock Bottom is a Brewery with brew-master Robb,  and all of their food is made from scratch by their head chef Korey. The Asiago crab dip was a great recommendation as well as the carrot cake for desert. Great suggestive selling. Our entrees were out in less than twenty minutes. We even had a couple of managers stop in periodically to check on us. I think their names were Nick and Kevin. Great guys. I am a mystery shopper by trade and always take notes on my visits.

After a recent renovation the place looks really good, but the service has fallen off a cliff. Waited 40 minutes for a standard lunch order to get to the table and the place was not even half full. There were at least 5 people working back in the kitchen -- I know because I finally had to go to the kitchen counter to ask to pay my bill so I could leave. Who has 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a salad lunch with a glass of water? The buffalo chicken on my salad consisted of 4 nuggets dipped in sauce. Oh, and to top it off I was charged full price for a kid's meal, which is an advertised special to be free on Tuesdays! I did not have my wits about me to compute that until I had already paid and left. So $44 for 2 adults and one kid to have lunch, including a 10% tip I gave the server purely as a courtesy. Between the food and the service it was barely worth half of that. Too bad to see this place go downhill with no attempt to make things right or compensate the customer."

I want to walk away from that feeling like 'That was incredible and I can't wait to go again'. That is not even close to what we felt. We got the 'newbie' waiter, so the service was not top notch. We were told the special came with a white wine sauce, only to overhear another waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce. Sure enough, it came out with a red sauce. If the price of the meal was in the $60 range I might not be so critical. But when you pay what I consider to be a pretty pricey cost...add to that the fact that the $9 glass of wine came from an $8 bottle (it was good wine, but I don't need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction), I would say it was just 'ok'. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth going back to when there are so many other great places in the area."

Jordan brings us our drinks and a loaf of bread with pesto. Jordan also bring me a salad with some kind of NUT/Seed concoction. I saw the nuts on my salad and told him to take it away. He said they are not NUTs they are pumpkin nuts. While eating my salad my mouth started burning. I was having an allergic reaction. I didn't know why. I asked my husband to google pesto. Pesto has PINE NUTS in them. We told Jordan and he said that pesto at Bonefish Grill does not have NUT. I then asked for hot tea. My allergic reaction made me nauseated so I rushed home. When I googles Bonefish Pesto this morning this I what I found \n\n1 cup basil leaves\n1/4 cup Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup PINE NUTS\n2 garlic cloves, chopped\n1/4 tsp salt\n6 Kalamata olives\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nI think servers should be knowledgeable about the items they are serving.

The only thing that takes away from this place for me seems to be the uncajun portions. You don't get a whole lot for what you pay for here like you would if you were down in Louisiana. But if you are looking to try to at least mimic that Cajun taste and feel, this is a good place to try."

This is probably like the only restaurant that doesn't offer bread \ud83c\udf5e while you're waiting for food. The table were seated at didn't seem to be cleaned off well enough. Our drinks being served in beer mugs was unappealing. The waitress was nice but didn't know whether or not she would be our server \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude1e.

Been all around different  cities and states to try different dimsum restaurants and have to say this place had some of the best dimsum we have ever had especially their Hong Kong duck!  Their dimsum tasted fresh unlike most that taste like it's been sitting in the freezer or fridge.  The duck was definitely melt in your mouth.  Great service as well!"

Besides other food, 3 in our group ordered gumbo,  2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo.\nThe food came out shortly after placing our orders.  \nIt was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix-up on the gumbos.  The person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa.  As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was 'yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time' .  WHAT?  Unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind.  \nSorry, Razzoo's Cajun Cafe, this could have been a much better review since the food itself was actually fairly good, but this kind of mistake is inexcusable."

I thought I had experienced a variety of Asian foods until I ate lunch at the Dragon Court.  This restaurant offers a nice family environment with a majority of Asians supporting the establishment.  Dragon Court is truly ethnic, offering the real deal.  Loved the food and environment.  Although the restaurant is located in an old shopping center with a pot hole ridden parking lot, you tend to forget about this after entering the Dragon Court because they offer  a clean environment. and great service.

After our waitress came to the table ONCE to apologize for the long wait between ordering drinks and appitizers then our food i finally asked her was there a reason our table was getting such poor service? her response to me was ' im sorry i had other tables and i had to close a big group out' i asked for the manager and explained to him the issue and he had no response or an apology!!! oh but he comped my appitizers all of ten dollars on an 80.00 BILL!!!!!!!!!!

We waited outside because it was standing room only. 70 minutes later I returned to the hostess stand and noted there was NO ONE waiting other than us. The Hostess was dumbstruck when I asked how much longer. She said there were no guests waiting/unseated. She asked me 3 times for my name and number in my party. She finally told me to go into the bar and she would find a server. I'll quickly bullet the rest on the evening:\n- not given water after asking\n- received drinks 20 minutes after ordering\n- 1 refill required extreme effort and 1 hour\n- food was cafeteria quality\n- server was superficially smiling but obviously perturbed\n- drunk panhandler was greeted by the barmaid by name. Larry then proceeded to ask table after table of diners for gas money. 4th table complained to the barmaid who finally asked Larry to leave.\n- salad refill never arrived.\n\nPreviously 3 stars:\nAsk for Server Lynette. She's the best!\nAvoid the Talapia. I suspect seafood ain't generally their strong suit"

After writing out what some of us should have on our bill they still messed it up! It took over 30 minutes before they got it 'right'. As compensation another waiter half heartedly gave some of us a voucher for a drink or app (no manager stopped by to apologize). After it was all said and done they still charged me for 2 tickets after reassuring me that the wrong one would be refunded. Such a shame the servers can't figure it out since the food and drinks were great."

But when you ask for a Jager Bomb or an Irish Car Bomb, then I think their  respective shots should drop/bomb into the drink.  In theory, that would happen if the shot was in..say...a shot glass.  They served the shot is a plastic medicine cup.  That makes it difficult to drink/bomb/enjoy.  The shot was just floating in the pint glass.\n\nDoes anyone remember Exxon Valdez?  Plastic is made of oil, and oil floats.\n\nAlso, one more thing.   The music is so damn loud, that I can't hear myself think about how loud the music is.  \n\nI understand...It tries to be classy, what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels, like a posh NYC night club...but this is a bowling alley.\n\nAn Alley."

But the overall experience was unacceptable. First of all, there wasn't a lot of customers. There were maybe 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. The waitress acted as if she didn't want her job. I had to remind her 3 times that I wanted lemon with my water. We ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay. I mean come on! It's water and tea. Any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty. The waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down. She did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was OK. It seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary. Any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers. This lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay. She then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us. We were given a review card before leaving. The experience was OK but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot!

After not checking if the keys were turned in, and initially saying 'no', he began to respond with things like, 'it's not my f***ing responsibility if you lost your keys',  'I don't have your keys you f***ing stupid b**ch,' and 'stop giving me attitude about your keys' (when she clearly wasn't). I was standing right next to her, and after repeated comments like this, I'd heard enough and said, 'hey man, the girl lost her keys, and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here, what is your problem?' He immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me 'What the f***k are you going to do about it?' (something I don't think was necessary, at all, at this point). He proceeds to call over security who says, 'Hey let's talk about this over here' (pointing to a spot away from the bar). I agreed saying, 'yes, let's talk about it' (after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt, by an overly aggressive bar tender).

A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."

It wasn't until later that i was treated very poorly. maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior i've incounter is unacceptable. I would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out. I was patient until I realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress. As a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking. (but of course thats just me) \nSecond, when my family & i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the 'kitchen was close' and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half  before closing time but even then that didn't much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it wasn't until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me .. they refuse to serve my family & i but served them no questions asked? I THINK NOT .. an apologe was not even giving to us. \nThirdly, the  DJ is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song. I as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee. As an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj .. \nThis resturant is a disappointment big time.  I would be damned if i step foot here again. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime!."

Trust me, the Optimator tastes much better on draft, along with the rest.  I've never left this place hungry, and I've yet to be disappointed with the food or service after going here for the past 15 years or so.  Be warned, German beer is not Miller lite.  If you're drinking a liter or more, make sure you're not driving.  Pretzel bread, there is none better.  Also, much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in Charlotte, for both food and beer.  Most of what I prefer is between $15 and $20, but there are also some worthwhile options in the low to mid twenties."

Their regular prices are not out of line with their food quality and portions. Average dinner entr\u00e9e seems to be $17.\n\nMy salmon was perfectly done; most evenly cooked I'd ever had at a restaurant. The almond rice was fantastic in the reisling sauce from the salmon. The Wurstplatte was as expected, and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different. \n\nThe Heisse Liebe desert (vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce & 'Peach Schnapps,' topped with homemade whipped cream) was incredibly flavorful, while the Apfelstrudel was understated but better than many."

The scallops were disturbingly gritty and under cooked, the short ribs were excessively greasy. It was all served over a pumpkin and parmesan polenta that was simply swimming in grease. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. \n\nMy check came out at $53.32. That comprised $26.95 for the entree, $14.95 for one glass of wine, $3.46 in tax... plus an automatic 20% gratuity ($7.96) attached by the server despite the fact that I was in a party of just two. \n\nOverall, it was a very poor experience."

        "Review": "Been waiting forever to try this place. In all honesty, I'll have to try a regular plate for a more unbiased opinion. To rate the food, it was 4/5. Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

        "Review": "Stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament.  My biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside (which I told them about several times) and the laundry/cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived (after 6pm).  In general, they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff.  But our room was clean, so that is good.  This is your typical Hyatt Place, so if you are familiar with the brand and layout, you know what to expect.  The lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast, but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful.  This hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators (which are in the hallways right behind the front desk, also used for access to/from the lobby and other rooms).   This was definitely a problem during high traffic times, you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators.  Very poor layout in my opinion.  Otherwise, the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a Hyatt Place, so if you like the layout it will be the same.   I really like the sitting area, it's quite large and has a big L-shaped sofa and a separate desk.  Really nice!   The only thing I don't like about these rooms is the 'open' bathroom area.  The sink is basically in the bedroom so it's very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready (like brushing your teeth) without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping.   But if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time, no problem.\nNegatives: Small lobby and breakfast area (cramped if busy), overflowing trash cans outside, a lot of laundry/cleaning carts in hallways, very cramped elevator location.\nPositives: Large rooms, new, modern, room was clean and quiet."

The pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to. There was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored,but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms. That did not make a difference. The pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do."

        "Review": "First, I would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job. Lucy, is an angel. It meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea. I know grandma CAN do it herself, but we encourage her to let us help her.  For anyone that looks after someone who has needs, the little things mean the world to people who take care of them. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. \n\nHowever, Hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people. It is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people (especially at night), as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped.  Bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location.\n\nThere was some confusion or miscommunication about the room I had booked. I booked a two bed room, and what I received was a one bed room with a pull out couch. The other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed. Truth be told, I was not stoked to sleep on the floor on Friday for $140 a night. However, we were able to move rooms on Saturday. \n\nHyatt! Spend the money and supply your staff team!\n\nHotel policy's are a 'hit and miss'.  What I mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay, but be charged for it another time. \n\nThere is apparently a $30 'damage fee' to cover any hotel property if ruined.  I was not charged this fee before, so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill. However, the kind desk manager, Joel, was able to remove it. \n\nThis is my second time at this hotel, and both times I had my dog. The first time I was not charged $75 (even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file). For the record, the dog is well behaved.  When I asked the manager (name?) about it, he simply told me that it was policy. I told the manager I understood, but if there if a policy, follow through with it at all times. He removed it, but honestly, the money didn't matter. It is more important that I can be informed.  I was frustrated. I felt like I was being  'dismissed' from the conversation by having the charge dropped. I want to be informed so I am prepared for the charge on my bill. \n\nBottom line, if you have a policy, follow through with it at all times. Inconsistency kills a business. I do not like to be surprised with 'fees' I was not informed of, nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel. \n\nI don't get to see my family as often as I like since I took a job in Florida, so these trips are special to us. I chose Hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends. I chose this particular location due to other customer reviews. My first visit compared to my last visit was night and day. \n\nWhen I left, I felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel. I am a client who like to 'have it together' as far as reservations and what to expect. I set this trip up for my family, and I feel like I failed them. \n\nIt was good to see old friends and family during my visit, but the hotel was not a nice stay."

I have to say the service was spectacular, and the server really presented everything well.  I of course had to have the steak, it was really good - when I asked them to do it medium, it actually WAS medium - not medium rare, etc.  Really well done.\n\nMy one complaint is that the floor space seemed slightly cramped but really not overly so, it gets a bit noisy for a place of this caliber, but short of that, it was an excellent experience.  We will definitely be back again, there is really little they can do to make it better than it is."

At one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well. We probably won't come back to Sports Connection next time for our group bowling. The staff was great! But the lanes need some serious TLC. When you're paying per hour, it's frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed. Again, great staff!

As we continue with our breakfast she kept walking around and looking at us like we are doing something wrong. Finally when we finished eating she came with the same attitude and told us that we need to take care of our plates.

Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of 'ethnic names and poor accents' and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.  This behavior was not only culturally bias in nature but unprofessional, offensive and lacked customer service. Congrats, hates off to Panera for employing a great group of court jesters!"

My plate came with some red jam on my bacon and eggs (there was nothing on my plate that had any red jam on it). Food was disgusting.

Can't decide?...get the fish and chips and beef on 'weck combo every Sunday. Great patio right on East, where you can relax with a cold drink and watch the world go by.

Walking in you get the impression it's going to be a good time and then it all went south.\n\nWe sat at our table for at least 10 - 15 minutes with no one checking on us then the server showed up smelling like she had just smoked a carton with Joe Camel. She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me 'fries with that'....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.\n\nPlaced our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. \n\nOur order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.\n\nAgain the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing. \n\nSo on the way out the door I mentioned this to the 'manager' and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service. I drop over $20 per person and all the guy could say was he would look into it. \n\nWon't be going back ever. There is a problem there and they don't care to fix it so I won't be back.

Then the salty bacon, the sweet jd's BBQ sauce paired with a medium flavor cheese and a salty crispy onion ring gave me something I was not expecting...pure mouth joy. The semi floppy  (requested) chips had this seasoning (salty, peppery sweet) that were amazing, too.

I was simply trying to let him know we'd be a large party, so he could possibly seat others accordingly to be able to accommodate a large party (since restaurants have a limited number of tables they can push together.) I was appalled by Lyle's tone, and unwillingness to even listen.  My thought was....do I really want to patron a restaurant where the management is rude and has no customer service skills??  I then called the Mallard Creek location and spoke to their manager Robert.  My entire office goes there for lunch together frequently and Mallard Creek always accommodates us.  Robert was courteous and professional.  He said he would be happy to work with us.  I thanked Robert for his professionalism and told him how rude Lyle was to me. Upon arrival, our table was ready, our server was personable and awesome!  At the end of the night, I was informed that Robert was going to comp my meal to make sure we had a good time and nice experience. Hickory Tavern on E. Arbors Drive is our new location.

The hostess, Juliana, was very pleasant and helpful as I was traveling from Columbia for dinner. After being seated at 7:15 on Monday evening, it wasn't until 7:45 before we had our drinks. We reluctantly had to ask the hostess to put in our appetizer orders. We had the Yellowfin tuna tartare and the charcuterie board which were well balanced and flavorful. Yet, it was still a constant struggle for service. \n\nOur server got our entree orders wrong and failed to bring out our 2nd round of drinks after multiple times of us requesting them. He also didn't come see us after we received our meal so I didn't get to eat what I ordered. I had the 10oz filet with bordelaise, which had fantastic flavor and texture - the bordelaise was a perfect accompaniment. To no surprise, paying the bill was just a difficult. \n\nTo my knowledge, the restaurant was launching a new menu tonight, which, understandably, could be problematic for some servers. The problem was that we routinely saw our waiter pass us to help out the other tables around us, yet he repeatedly neglected to attend to our table. I expect more in terms of service when I pay $120 for a dinner for two. It pained me to even leave a decent tip. The food, on the contrary, was phenomenal - which is why I gave the rating 2 stars. The interior had a very upbeat and lively atmosphere."

The restaurant provides a more upscale feel without the price tag. The food is fantastic and the service OMG it can not be matched. We are very picky about our thai food. Believe me no other thai restaurant in town touches this place."

He got the number 20 with seafood. About an hour later he spent the entire night throwing up and having diarrhea. I called first thing in the morning to warn them and the manager was EXTREMELY rude. Didn't care and kept saying 'well what can I do about it' I told him he probably should not sell that batch of soup and at least refund that meal. He would not do anything and said there is no way of knowing it was from his food. So disappointed, what awful service."

The Wagyu steak was good, but I could do better for cheaper.  Another dish we were served was barely-cooked vegetables.  Everyone was appropriately apologetic, but due to the slow service and limited vegetable options, we had to just leave it.  My recommendation to the place?  Less expensive fancy cuts of meat and more attention to the easy details -- like cooking vegetables!\n\nIf you want to try something new in Charlotte, you might want to move this one down the list til they can sort their kitchen issues."

Wings are great (they make their own sauces in-house), and the pizza options are plentiful and crowd-pleasers.  You can always count on a great draft beer list, featuring primarily local/state beer.

It was very neat and tidy, nicely decorated, and comfortable.  It is a place you can actually enjoy a good meal and hold a conversation you can hear for change.  The food was fantastic (try the stuffed boneless chicken wings... you will be as stuffed and happy as they are, just delicious).  The green curry was equally as good.  The staff and owners are so nice to talk with too.  We will definitely be coming back!"

I got lucky, I needed a table for two, and the hostess offered to seat us despite a full reservation list, and she she kindly asked if we would mind if we needed to be finished by 8:30 (we were seated around 7).  I personally appreciated that, instead of being turned away.   We both ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the food came very fast, waitresses were constantly checking in, refilling drinks, and we were satiated and finished by 7:45.  I'd prefer a lunch sandwich here more than paying the same for a jersey mikes sub, which are pretty good, but not as good as what they serve here."

The bar was fine if you get a seat away from the front door. They have a neat fish tank and the bartender was attentive to drinks and food which was nice. If you like hot tea I would highly recommend getting a pot of their hot tea. It is delicious and some of the best tea I have had. I'm not a big burger fan so I've only stuck with the sushi here. They have some nice combinations and some good options if you want to stay away from anything fried (although fried anything is so good).  My favorite so far is the tropical storm roll because it comes with a decent amount of fish and a nice sauce. If you want an appetizer, the tuna-Tini is really good and is a pretty good portion.  Good food, good atmosphere."

Was a bit messy/soggy and it pretty well fell apart towards the end, but still good and worth it.\n\nThey have a really good selection of hot sauces, ranked 1-10, so grabbed a couple of small cups of them for garnish on the sandwich.\n\nWait time to get the sandwich was a little long, especially when you measure against JJ or Subway, but the wait was worth it."

I ordered a chicken sandwich and the presentation was nice and the fruit salad was beautiful. However the chicken was undercooked and disgusting, completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick. The texture!!! I know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it. I hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked. He looked at it and insisted it was fine, that it's how the cook it on the flat top or something like that. He did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all- just snatched my plate up and walked away. I sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes. He completely ignored me for the rest of the meal, as if I had done something wrong. I noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so I guess they figured all was settled. But I take poor service and lack of pride in serving edible meals to be a big deal. I won't be returning to this establishment ever again."

We were seated at a dirty table by a very rude gentleman. We then sat there for twenty minutes. During that time we were not acknowledged in any way. Nobody came to take our drink order; nobody even looked at us. There were empty tables everywhere and the wait staff didn't seem to be busy as the lunch rush was just wrapping up. The menus on the table and the absence of beverages should have been an indicator that we hadn't been helped. We got up to leave and nobody seemed to care. We left and nobody said goodbye. I'm disappointed, and sadly, will probably not eat there again."

Finally got things sorted and had a pretty decent dinner. Food came out non-stop and all of the meats were good. The salad bar was a little lack luster and didn't provide many sides for the meat course. Overall it was a good night."

Anybody in the kitchen with half a brain would make some new sliders without pickles. She brought the same sliders back and they just took the pickles off. Crap I could have done that. There's still pickle juice all over the sliders. I told the girl what happened and she found it humorous. I was not amused."

I visited Chima last week with some friends and I would say that if you are hungry for some good food and enjoy good customer service then you should visit them soon. The experience was good from the moment you walk into their beautiful establishment. Greeted with warm smiles and hostesses eager to take care of your needs. The mood is nice with the dimmed lights and soft music. The service is good. No waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress. Orders are there in a timely manner, and table is cleared almost instantly. The meat is circulating around like clockwork and is always hot and juicy with flavors that melt in your mouth. Their salad bar features many different options of salads from Mixed Greens to Pasta salads. It also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice. At the table, they bring many different side dishes, which is something I haven't experienced at a Brazilian Steak House before. Even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one. I did however, had an issue with the valet parking I didn't get as stated on their website(update site with start time). My waitress did send a manager my way, he explained the rule(law) that the states has about valet parking(knowledge) and even offered to split the cost for the parking deck payment. I was all smiles after that. I left Chima  happy, stuff and could barely walk but satisfied with the outcome overall. Chima, you will see me again. Thank you for a wonderful evening.By the way, try the Brazilian soda called Guarana Antarctica...SO GOOD"

I was sold. Shortly afterwards, I visited the restaurant to try other food items. I have yet to be disappointed. Everyone there is always friendly. I LOVE JIM AND NICKS! I wish there was one closer to home. But it's always a treat to have that smoked tender BBQ. And the Mac and Cheese is to die for.

Did I mention it is all you can eat? Tons of different meats to choose from and cooked all different ways. Try as many as you like or as few as you like, however I recommend trying as many as you can. Expensive, however for the amount of food you get (as much as you want), it is much more bang for your buck than some of the other high end restaurants around town. Extremely fun and interesting atmosphere as well, every visit is another great experience!"

We met with the event coordinator, Kay Emad, and squared away all details for the day. Kay assured me that every detail we discussed would be met on the day of. When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve."

I respect their pride for their work. \n\nIt is a small place that is sometimes packed, it can be slow to be seated, served, and to pay. Sometimes the server can be seen as rude, especially when they are busy. Thats just the way it is here. \n\nI personally think its a privilege to have sushi, ramen and other Japanese dishes of such quality available to me, so everything else is forgivable. \n\n90% of the time i have an awesome experience with the service at this restaurant.  100% of the time the food is great. \n\nIf you can set aside entitlement and just allow time for this place you will be in for a treat."

Management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not 'being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities'. I was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an 'activity'. This should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas. Accidents are very likely to happen during crowded times if this is not mandated."

We still go, every birthday and anniversary and special occasions...or if we are anywhere close to Matthews.  We made it for my wife's birthday this past month, and the power was out.  They were great and served us in the dark.  Good thing we had cash...no power to work the credit card machine!

        "Review": "I'm no restaurant critic but Aria is the best.\nI go here like once a month.\n\nAlmost every person who works there calls me by name when they see me. The atmosphere is fancy enough that you can impress a date but casual enough that you two won't feel out of place if you come in jeans and use a salad fork for your entree.\n\nThere isn't one mean server in the house. They are all friendly (Robbie is the best!) and I'm always impressed with how well they know the menu. I'm not a huge drinker so I'm always ordering virgin drinks. I've never had a non alcoholic drink that didn't taste like a cool spring breeze lol (Rachel is the bartender I like). \n\n You don't wait long for food, it comes out exactly when it should. Speaking of food, I rate it a ten. \n\nTop 3 Apps\n- Aria Caesar Salad (keep the anchovies, I promise they work really well with it. I used to be a no anchovies kinda girl too)\n- Gnocchi (the appetizer, I haven't tried the spinach gnocchi entree yet)\n- SHAVED KALE SALAD!!! PERFECTOOOOO!!\n\nTop 3 Entrees\n- Spaghetti and Meatballs\n- The steak is awesome, if you have a little money to blow.\n- FETTUCCINE CARBONARA! add blackened shrimp and thank Robbie for the bomb suggestion.\n\nBest dessert award goes to the Blackberry Cheesecake! Hands down! \n\nMake sure you get a cappuccino and ask Dennis (the hottest guy ever) for some whipped cream. Thank me later ladies. :)\n\nBottom line, Aria rocks! Great food, great music, and the greatest service ever. Make a reservation if you can because they do fill up fast some nights, even though I never make one and always get a table (but it's purely good luck). Make sure you try the bread, cause Lorrrrdddddd it's the best."

I ordered the blackened chicken tacos, my husband ordered the BBQ pulled pork dinner and my kids had a cheeseburger slider and cheese pizza and might I add the kids ate for free. And we also had a bucket of beer. I mean the atmosphere alone was amazing. Both managers were welcoming and gave us two different kinds of desserts for free since we were new to their restaurant, and the desserts (southern style bread pudding and double fudge brownie sundae) were literally to die for! And our waitress Ashleigh was amazing and attentive. Overall it was a fantastic experience. I would definitely recommend everyone I know and I would go there again myself."

        "Review": "We were disappointed with every restaurant we tried in Charlotte city.This is a very special and unique Indian restaurant. Most Indian restaurants serve dishes within a narrow range of flavors - a range that those of us who eat in the U.S. have grown accustomed and used to. It's familiar and perhaps a bit boring. Well, get ready for a new adventure if you go here. They have all the traditional dishes - but they come with a twist, a spice, a flavor, a sauce, that you likely haven't seen, smelled, or tasted before. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which was scrumptious. I can't remember what my wife had to eat, because I obsessed and cherished over my own so. But I do remember that she was very impressed. I personally think this place is magisterial in their Indian cooking. If you don't know what that means, I'll just say the cuisine here rocks. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Wish they were located in my hometown.  This one is an exception. You'll be in for a treat if you're in the mood for Indian food. We love this place & will continue to come back!!"

The prices are a little high but then again this is not your average fast food join. The sides seemed fresh.  The layout of this restaurant is pretty nice. There's a huge bar area in the center but yet it's a great place for kids too.  The menu is pretty extensive - I ordere the chicken critters since I'm not a big steak fan, they were fresh and juicy!! Overall our experience was better than expected."

Next time it sent back the owner John brought it out and this time it was done right. But it turned into a 3 couse meal. I eat my salad. then I had my vegetables, low and behold had a steak last. The week before that I was in around 6pm and ordered Salmon and the middle was raw, raw. I was eating at the Lucky Texan about 3 times every two weeks. I have now switched to Outback on Independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks. Steaks excellent , service good. John, owner of TRH should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge match. Owner should be a little more humble and not act like the customer in the wrong. He never apologized to me so I took it that he did not care if I came back. Did not penalize the server, always tip because I know it is not the server. Thanks John, I am getting my steak cooked properly."

The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's.

We started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way, the plantains weren't cooked either and the rice was COLD. It was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us, because they were closing, as I was filling up my drink I noticed that they were just re-heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator.

We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good. \n\nBruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.\n\nCalamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better fried calamari in other restaurant this one was no that good. \n\nAsparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it. \n\nFor my main course I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it. \n\nMare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cook perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk. \n\nThe service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection. But like I say the Mare saved the day."

Having just returned from vacation in the Outer Banks, I was skeptical of an inland seafood restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised. The blackened swordfish special was exceptional, even better than the similar special I enjoyed only a week earlier in Nags Head. My wife had the shrimp pasta and loved it as well.\n\nTo top off the excellent food, we had great service, including the struggles that come from eating out with a toddler. \n\nThe only thing I can nit-pick is that the seating was uncomfortable to me, but I wasn't thinking much about that as I enjoyed my meal. \n\nThanks for a great experience for our anniversary!"

The shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall. We ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash. The server argued and said the Chef said it had lobster. Fyi my family is from Maine and knew there was no lobster. The crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought. When we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold. The peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream.  This experience embarrassed me for having to bring my family and friends to such a low level high priced dinner.  Never again."

        "Review": "During my visit to Charlotte,  decided to try Mama's based upon reviews.  Our server is what kept the rating from being a full five star experience.  Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

        "Review": "1 of 5 stars Pending review\nMy husband and i ate here on jan 1,2016 and the food was awful. i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens. The grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges. If that wasn't bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate. It was so overbearing I couldn't taste the potatoes or the collards. I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that I wanted and i said no just take it off the bill. Now since this restaurant is listed as an 'upscale' restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was. Well I guess not as no one came so i guess they don't really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket. We also had a 'cup' which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp & lobster bisque and there wasn't a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty. We paid the bill but since they don't seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again. on the way home I was reading their reviews and wished that I had done that before going as there were many bad reviews.\n\nVisited January 2016"

They did away with our favorite salmon dish and changed to some other fish that was inedible. Presentation was beyond basic - the fish was on an essentially empty plate. Service was some of the worst I've ever had - the lady couldn't understand anything. Not to mention, we had planned a birthday surprise, dropping off cake and candles before dinner. The waitress literally came out and asked the entire table 'Should I put the candles in the cake or do you guys want to do it?'. Ruining the entire surprise for the birthday. Won't be back here."

The food's good, especially for the price.\n\nI've had some inconsistencies, though - a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy, a couple of steaks that have been too well-done for the medium-rare I normally order. I wish there were more appetizing healthy options - the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted, and most of the best savory foods they have on offer are drowning in butter, but I suppose that's what you're going to get with this kind of restaurant. \n\nI always leave feeling full, and it always feels like I more or less got my money's worth - and the staff is really fantastic."

Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

Lately I don't know if they have new management or staff but the service really went down the drain. Went down there for my daughter's birthday to celebrate and seemed like that they were doing us a favor by been in there. So we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and it's been months. Decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there. Waiter was rude and quick with his responses, he didn't bring everything we ordered form the the start. We had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like I was bothering him by asking. Than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks. When we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last night's leftovers. I know how hard the waiting staff work and I never have tipping less then 20%. But today is the first time I left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left $0.00 tip. If you want to eat here throw your money in the trash can out side and eat some grass on the side of the road and you'll have better experience."

I was told by the blond hostess she could not accommodate a large party outside in the shade. She offered us a table inside or suggested we wait until it became cloudy. I had to ask.. When did she think it would be cloudy? Lol. Anyways I told her no thank you, I will come back when it's cloudy. I was not impressed. Now after reading some of these reviews I am happy we went elsewhere. My suggestion to groups of more than two..go elsewhere."

        "Review": "This is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached, not a brewery. If you're trying to eat here on a budget... don't. That's the best advice, I suppose.\n\nAim away from peak hours, for better service, and I personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles, especially for the price - I'm not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up Fried Chicken, but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing, and the waffle was nothing special. To make matters worse, it was served vertically, on a spike, without any clear way to approach it.\n\nI'm rambling. My general view of the menu is that it's focusing too much on being gourmet, and not enough on being... well, GOOD. Another reviewer got it spot-on - the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas.\n\nGreat and (slowly) rotating selection of Belgian and farmhouse style beers, one of the better places for the style in Charlotte if that's what you're into (which is what earns it the third star), but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd that's used to the city's higher-end dining and nightlife. If you've got money to burn on food or mixed drinks, or you're just here for the beer, you could do worse than a night at Heist."

Maybe three nuggets of assorted chicken bits, but well outweighed by the other stuff.  Picture attached to my review.\n- I didn't get a beer menu until after I got my food.  Would have ordered my first beer differently had I got a menu.\n- 5 Stars of Heat for spicy garlic sauce?  Maybe that is the case, but there was so little chicken in the tacos I couldn't tell."

Most of them are married, so I guess they cannot be bothered to be nice to patrons.  This Hooters is old and out of date. Many other Hooters have been renovated. The overall atmosphere is that they are doing you a favor by serving you. \n\nI understand that Hooters will hire anyone now to be an equal opportunity employer, but some pleasant staff would be nice."

The trivia questions on trivia night were laughable. If you want to go somewhere that hosts Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader nights then this is your place. It would not have been so awful if our server was even around. We had 1 beer the whole night because our server was not present to even ask if we wanted another beer or refill on water.

Me my wife with my 2 daughters love it here. Will recommend it to everyone in our community. #TheBlueTaj"

We ordered several dishes to share and everything was much better that we all expected. The only 'complaint' was that it wasn't as spicy as we all were used to. They did ask us how spicy we wanted everything (we chose 3/5). I think we have a better understanding of their spicy-scale and will adjust accordingly for next time. We will definitely be back. Very reasonable prices for good food. Recommended."

Menu is a bit pricey. But overall I would say it's worth it. The dizzy Mumbai was great cocktail. Service was excellent, our waiter was prompt and attentive."

The Young Tom Turkey that was on diners drive inn and dives that is so good with the homemade dressing. Friday nights they have baked mac collard and fried squash corn. Veggie plates will fill you up. The host are great with the deserts. THE DESERTS are Fresh they have a bakery whaat. take care of those hard working Servers. Best food and the Prime Rib well just go to go orders too."

We were charged extra for the sides that came included with the meal. He was then very, very rude upon our check out and instructed the cashier to 'handle the patrons behind us' while we were standing in front of her getting our bill straightened out, which never occured. $31.37 was paid for a fish meal with grits and eggs, and an egg plate with sasauge. I will absolutley never return. Very poir customer service."

I appreciated the expedient service, but the overcooked shrimp in my jumbo shrimp scampi were hard to overlook. Given my previous pleasant dining experiences at the diner, I was disappointed. The chocolate cake made up for the shrimp, though. I will be coming back, I have too much nostalgia tied to this place to let one bad dinner determine any future consumption of whatever else Landmark has to offer. Jeepers, this is comprehensively pretentious given that my only real complaint was some rubbery shrimp."

They are the equivalent of sitting in economy class on a commercial airliner except they are vinyl which makes them even more uncomfortable.  The old seat were wide and swiveled and rocked.  The old seats were an improvement on traditional theater seats.  The new ones are worse than traditional theater seats.  They are miserably uncomfortable and made it difficult to concentrate on the movie."

After a recent renovation the place looks really good, but the service has fallen off a cliff. Waited 40 minutes for a standard lunch order to get to the table and the place was not even half full. There were at least 5 people working back in the kitchen -- I know because I finally had to go to the kitchen counter to ask to pay my bill so I could leave. Who has 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a salad lunch with a glass of water? The buffalo chicken on my salad consisted of 4 nuggets dipped in sauce. Oh, and to top it off I was charged full price for a kid's meal, which is an advertised special to be free on Tuesdays! I did not have my wits about me to compute that until I had already paid and left. So $44 for 2 adults and one kid to have lunch, including a 10% tip I gave the server purely as a courtesy. Between the food and the service it was barely worth half of that. Too bad to see this place go downhill with no attempt to make things right or compensate the customer."

Dragon Court is truly ethnic, offering the real deal.  Loved the food and environment.  Although the restaurant is located in an old shopping center with a pot hole ridden parking lot, you tend to forget about this after entering the Dragon Court because they offer  a clean environment. and great service.

Besides other food, 3 in our group ordered gumbo,  2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo.\nThe food came out shortly after placing our orders.  \nIt was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix-up on the gumbos.  The person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa.  As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was 'yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time' .  WHAT?  Unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind.  \nSorry, Razzoo's Cajun Cafe, this could have been a much better review since the food itself was actually fairly good, but this kind of mistake is inexcusable."

The decor and theme is well put together and the lighting is very dim especially at night, and at that time it's best to get a window seat.

After writing out what some of us should have on our bill they still messed it up! It took over 30 minutes before they got it 'right'. As compensation another waiter half heartedly gave some of us a voucher for a drink or app (no manager stopped by to apologize). After it was all said and done they still charged me for 2 tickets after reassuring me that the wrong one would be refunded.

It turned out to be one the worst decisions that I made in my life. First of all, I was treated rudely by the front-desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there. Well, I admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places, but I still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several Spanish-speaking dudes who were checking out before me, and who were clearly pointing, looking, and making fun of me... However, I wouldn't give the place 1-star just for that reason alone. On top of that, the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago. I even found a hair in my eggplant, and ended up throwing away about half of the food. I will NEVER come there again. A good thing is that I don't even live anywhere remotely near this place."

I asked why is it so hard to seat one person she said she don't know.  So the male hostess asked was I being seated I said idk I thought I was.  So I said never mind I'll eat elsewhere.

But the overall experience was unacceptable. First of all, there wasn't a lot of customers. There were maybe 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. The waitress acted as if she didn't want her job. I had to remind her 3 times that I wanted lemon with my water. We ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay. I mean come on! It's water and tea. Any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty. The waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down. She did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was OK. It seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary. Any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers. This lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay. She then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us. We were given a review card before leaving. The experience was OK but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot! My boyfriend and I believe in tipping excellent customer service. Well this lady didn't deserve a cent of the tip I left."

Ordered pancakes and omelets, took at least 40 min. Started timing it only after getting anxious. All tables around us were waiting. One gentleman was just brought his food and he immediately asked for his check, which didn't come for 10 min. Then when we went to pay, there was no pen to sign.

My boyfriend's corn was extremely salty as well.\n\nIn addition, the a la carte style means that you're going to be spending a good chunk of your paycheck there.

This restaurant is busy practically every single night and is usually very loud (loud people and acoustics).  I will never forget one of the taller male bar tenders one time was extremely loud and obnoxious, going on and cussing for some stupid reason and was rude to customers.  I have no tolerance for bar tenders that are so full of themselves that they pretend they are exempt from excellent customer service.  Even with these bad experiences, the up scale restaurant is quite well decorated in a historic building and the food was great, during my visits anyway; probably the best in Mooresville.  It is worth a well planned visit sometime for a special event or just a hop on your bar run."

Trust me, the Optimator tastes much better on draft, along with the rest.  I've never left this place hungry, and I've yet to be disappointed with the food or service after going here for the past 15 years or so.  Be warned, German beer is not Miller lite.  If you're drinking a liter or more, make sure you're not driving.  Pretzel bread, there is none better.  Also, much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in Charlotte, for both food and beer.  Most of what I prefer is between $15 and $20, but there are also some worthwhile options in the low to mid twenties."

        "Review": "I visited last month with some friends who were visiting from Georgia. They picked the place and I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical about Riccio's. After all, it's located in a middle-of- the-woods shopping center that I didn't even know existed!\n\n(Before I review, I must tell you that my little group of pals are VERY chit-chatty, and we can't stop talking.)\n\nThe waitress kindly sat us, all 5 of us, even though the biggest table they had was sat only 4 people. This was probably the only bad thing.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked and the waitress came by every ten minutes to ask about our drink orders, which we finally placed. This was our fault, she was just doing her job.\n\nAnother hour goes by and we finally place our meal order, which included pizzas and different Italian dishes. The food came rather fast and, I can't speak for my friends, but my pizza was cooked perfectly, made-to-order. It was hot and fresh and gooey and oh-so-good.\n\nBy the time we finished our talking, we had realized that the restaurant had actually CLOSED DOWN around us, and we were there at least a half hour after closing. The staff never mentioned it though, which was super-nice and accommodating. I would've expected them to kick us out, which they didn't.\n\nSo overall, great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices too- two pizzas were just $12 + tax and tip."

The Wurstplatte was as expected, and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different. \n\nThe Heisse Liebe desert (vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce & 'Peach Schnapps,' topped with homemade whipped cream) was incredibly flavorful, while the Apfelstrudel was understated but better than many."

With that said, the ribs are the best. I can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all. Why? Well it's not because I'm a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite. 5'9, 150. It's because the ribs are so good that I am not even thinking about how full I am. The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is insane. And throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and I am happier than a pig in... Do yourself a favor and get the ribs!!

All the other food is great as well and it's a  great place to try new dishes including fried chicken skin nachos, rocky mountain oysters, etc. The drinks are phenomenal as well, especially their Moscow mule. Warning though, if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait up to an hour, possibly two, for a table inside. I will say though, it's more than worth the wait."

The place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters, exposed brick walls, eclectic light fixtures, and a peacock over the sushi bar. It is a bit loud, but the DJ spun music is good.\n\nThe food is a great collection of modern interpretations of regional classics in small plates to share. There are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine (but I didn't have enough room to sample). With all of this, there are also simple kebab options, and dip options. Then there's the sushi bar and menu. Yes, eclectic. But tasty and done well.\n\nCoctails are good, wine list is good, and the beer list seemed a bit short, but with more than enough liquors to make up for it. Probably the best bourbon list I've seen since we left Kentucky!"

It doesn't seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest/customer even when it's not busy. It also doesn't have the 'sanitary' feel to it (sanitary grade 96.0). I noticed that not all the staff wear gloves/hair net/hat when handling food. Food it self doesn't look/taste fresh. I had the Noda salad for lunch and it tasted like it's been out all day. Great location - It seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee. However, based on my experience, I wouldn't order anything simply because I wouldn't wanna get sick. It's kinda like waffle house...if that makes any sense."

Great breakfast all day items and I love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items. Love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly. Service and professionalism need improvement. \n\nOn a recent visit, we sat outside (brought the dog; bad idea; July heat) and waited 5-10 minutes before receiving water (repeat... July heat) or menus. Not a great start...but OK. We then proceeded to sit for another 50 minutes before receiving our food.  \n\nThough the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant, the kitchen performance was also spotty...  Parts of the meal were freshly made; other items (ie biscuits and gravy) had heavily congealed; revealing it had sat ready for SOME TIME before it was served. Lines happen and kitchens get backed up; this is not the issue. I will wait for good food; just don't make me wait and then serve bad food.\n \nThe server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server. Perhaps something to be dealt with behind closed doors?"

Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of 'ethnic names and poor accents' and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.

I was simply trying to let him know we'd be a large party, so he could possibly seat others accordingly to be able to accommodate a large party (since restaurants have a limited number of tables they can push together.) I was appalled by Lyle's tone, and unwillingness to even listen.  My thought was....do I really want to patron a restaurant where the management is rude and has no customer service skills??  I then called the Mallard Creek location and spoke to their manager Robert.  My entire office goes there for lunch together frequently and Mallard Creek always accommodates us.  Robert was courteous and professional.  He said he would be happy to work with us.  I thanked Robert for his professionalism and told him how rude Lyle was to me.

Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.\n\nPlaced our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. \n\nOur order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.\n\nAgain the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing.

We both ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the food came very fast, waitresses were constantly checking in, refilling drinks, and we were satiated and finished by 7:45.  I'd prefer a lunch sandwich here more than paying the same for a jersey mikes sub, which are pretty good, but not as good as what they serve here."

When we got up to walk away, walked right past the manager and he didn't even bother to ask why we were leaving... I guess they don't care. Next time I'll stick to going to Basil Thai instead."

Compared to other sub places, the prices really are not much more, and the quality is so much better than most places!\nMake sure you pick up a rewards card when you go in, once you register it you'll get a free drink, and a free sandwich once you reach 32(maybe 36?) points. \nLOVE WHICHWICH!"

Sometimes the server can be seen as rude, especially when they are busy. Thats just the way it is here. \n\nI personally think its a privilege to have sushi, ramen and other Japanese dishes of such quality available to me, so everything else is forgivable. \n\n90% of the time i have an awesome experience with the service at this restaurant.  100% of the time the food is great. \n\nIf you can set aside entitlement and just allow time for this place you will be in for a treat."

The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's. This place is beautiful but not worth the money, stress, or headache."

        "Review": "We were disappointed with every restaurant we tried in Charlotte city.This is a very special and unique Indian restaurant. Most Indian restaurants serve dishes within a narrow range of flavors - a range that those of us who eat in the U.S. have grown accustomed and used to. It's familiar and perhaps a bit boring. Well, get ready for a new adventure if you go here. They have all the traditional dishes - but they come with a twist, a spice, a flavor, a sauce, that you likely haven't seen, smelled, or tasted before. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which was scrumptious. I can't remember what my wife had to eat, because I obsessed and cherished over my own so. But I do remember that she was very impressed. I personally think this place is magisterial in their Indian cooking. If you don't know what that means, I'll just say the cuisine here rocks. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Wish they were located in my hometown.  This one is an exception. You'll be in for a treat if you're in the mood for Indian food. We love this place & will continue to come back!!"

After squeezing into the most difficult 'business' spot EVER, I was greeted by a smug face notifying me they were closed, while standing behind a 'hours of operation' sign that clearly stated they were open for 55 additional minutes. \n\nKeep in mind, I visited this establishment's website prior to leaving the house to ensure they would be open so you can understand my frustration. \n\nObviously this business owner doesn't understand that the customer is the MOST important link in the successful business plan. \n\nI found my way to another Subway establishment in Gateway Plaza, that to my utmost surprise was open and able to serve me when their website stated they would be... What a way to do business! \n\nIf you're looking for a late evening sandwich, I would suggest finding your way to this Gateway Subway. If you're looking to damage your vehicle, and NOT have your late evening cravings satisfied, by all means head over to this non-operational franchise... You may want to call first though or make a reservation and by all means don't plan on toasting, that's probably been down since breakfast IF they're open. \n\nThis is NOT the subs you're looking for..."

Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good. \n\nBruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.\n\nCalamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better fried calamari in other restaurant this one was no that good. \n\nAsparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it. \n\nFor my main course I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it. \n\nMare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cook perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk. \n\nThe service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection.

The food's good, especially for the price.\n\nI've had some inconsistencies, though - a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy, a couple of steaks that have been too well-done for the medium-rare I normally order. I wish there were more appetizing healthy options - the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted, and most of the best savory foods they have on offer are drowning in butter, but I suppose that's what you're going to get with this kind of restaurant. \n\nI always leave feeling full, and it always feels like I more or less got my money's worth - and the staff is really fantastic."

Lately I don't know if they have new management or staff but the service really went down the drain. Went down there for my daughter's birthday to celebrate and seemed like that they were doing us a favor by been in there. So we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and it's been months. Decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there. Waiter was rude and quick with his responses, he didn't bring everything we ordered form the the start. We had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like I was bothering him by asking. Than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks. When we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last night's leftovers. I know how hard the waiting staff work and I never have tipping less then 20%. But today is the first time I left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left $0.00 tip. If you want to eat here throw your money in the trash can out side and eat some grass on the side of the road and you'll have better experience."

But the Charlotte Marriott City Center gets 2 HUGE strikes right now. Never again. I've been here twice and both experiences have been very negative. \n\nOne...the 'mobile key' app they so-hyped since I checked in is glitchy and not ready for prime time. I spent about 5 minutes standing at my door trying to get it to open my door to no avail. I got a message on my phone saying go to the front desk to get a physical key. Their explanation? 'Oh, sometimes it's a little iffy'. You know what? Don't promote it and hype it until it is solidly working. Having worked in IT and dealing with mobile apps...terrible execution. \n\nTwo...I don't like housekeeping in my room, due to past bad experiences. I always put the 'Do not disturb' sign on, and someone from the hotel even saw me put it up this morning and acknowledged it. In my 18 years of reserving rooms myself, I've never had anyone come into my room after putting the sign on, in any type of hotel. But it happened today. Now I don't know who took the sign off, but someone did and all my stuff is now rearranged and I am not happy. So Marriott...it's on you or your clientele."

        "Review": "Northlake Mall has to make a choice, and make it now:  The Investors who own the mall have allowed the management company to condone an atmosphere of rampant under 20 year-olds who are disrespectful, loud and threatening to anyone who isn't a part of their crowd.  On Friday and Saturday evenings, the mall's main entrance closest to the AMC Theatre becomes an outdoor gang recruitment center complete with cars playing music so loud you can't hear yourself think.\nThis 'scene' has led to two separate shooting incidents in the last two years - though not on weekend nights.  This past Christmas one of those incidents involved a shootout with a Charlotte Police Officer who killed the thug.\n \nThe variety of stores is still good, although there have been several stores that left.  Johnston & Murphy Men's Shoes, a high end store, closed, Italian restaurant BRAVO Cucina Italiana closed, among others."

Ate at the Auntie Annies with Cinnabon, good eat. The tables we sat at across from them however were a it gross, sticky surfaces and crumbs but that's mall seating not specifically theirs. Small food court but they had a Taco Bell and Sbarro in there. 2 level mall, easily walked from end to end in under an hour if you don't go I'm any stores. It was air conditioned and overall clean. I would visit here again when in the area."

Most of them are married, so I guess they cannot be bothered to be nice to patrons.  This Hooters is old and out of date. Many other Hooters have been renovated. The overall atmosphere is that they are doing you a favor by serving you. \n\nI understand that Hooters will hire anyone now to be an equal opportunity employer, but some pleasant staff would be nice."

Maybe three nuggets of assorted chicken bits, but well outweighed by the other stuff.  Picture attached to my review.\n- I didn't get a beer menu until after I got my food.  Would have ordered my first beer differently had I got a menu.\n- 5 Stars of Heat for spicy garlic sauce?  Maybe that is the case, but there was so little chicken in the tacos I couldn't tell."

When my wife told the server the dish was salty, the kitchen manager took it upon himself to come up from the back in his grubby clothes with a bowl of it, pull a chair up to her and my son's table, and proceed to eat it.  Then tell her she might be right but he would know normally since he doesn't try the food.  Then he paraded around to the other staff in an obvious attempt to make a mockery of the situation.  My wife left the place feeling angry, embarrassed, and humiliated.  This guy should not be in the business unless as a janitor."

Ordered Verde Veggie burrito w/Napolito salad and ate on patio on a very hot day. They bring table nachos w/a uniquely hearty corn salsa that tastes pretty good. PROS - Food was VERY fresh and very flavorful; server was EXTREMELY friendly; reggae tunes were mellow and set the beachfront Caribbean atmosphere; & despite 90\u00b0+ temps the patio somehow attracted a nice breeze. CONS (for me) - very old, grubby looking vintage walls, floor, & decor; and indoor seating tables are very close to each other."

The dumplings were delicious but I wish they had placed a few more on the plate. My entree came with the sushi roll we ordered and I felt like they didn't give me a proper portion. The rest of my friends had plenty of food filling their bowls, which were huge by the way. Who ever designed the menu really likes pineapple because almost every other item had pineapple in it. The sushi just didn't pan out like I was expecting it to. I know when dining in any city like Charlotte, food is going to be marked up. But, when that's the case, at least put some effort into it. The rice was too dry, and the vegetables in it were lacking their natural juices as well leaving the entire roll flavorless. Presentation was okay. It kinda looked like someone was in a rush when plating the sushi. Honestly you'd save more money and time going to Harris Teeter and grabbing some sushi and a bottle of wine. \n\nTL:DR\nSushi is better elsewhere and it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nAnd for God's sake, please get a new DJ. So many lame remixes of current pop songs set to an 80's bass track"

The trivia questions on trivia night were laughable. If you want to go somewhere that hosts Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader nights then this is your place. It would not have been so awful if our server was even around. We had 1 beer the whole night because our server was not present to even ask if we wanted another beer or refill on water.

Mussels were bland and barely warm and I think undercooked because they were slimy.  The beef on the sliders was chewy and gray.  Next, dinner.  It was warm, but very bland.  The halibut was dry and there was a tiny bit of slimy crab meat on top.  The lamb was chewy, but the mashed potatoes were good.  Not going back.  Disappointing."

Service was what is expected for a restaurant of this caliber. Not exceptional my drink sat empty for a while .  Their water is so awful that four lemons could not mask the taste..  creme Burlee was good.     There are better and less costly steaks back home."

They are the equivalent of sitting in economy class on a commercial airliner except they are vinyl which makes them even more uncomfortable.  The old seat were wide and swiveled and rocked.  The old seats were an improvement on traditional theater seats.  The new ones are worse than traditional theater seats.  They are miserably uncomfortable and made it difficult to concentrate on the movie."

A guy was constantly on his phone and wasn't engaging with the customers. Loud profanity was used when coworkers engaged and they openly talked bad about customers that they didn't like for whatever reason. Our movie experience was great. Someone came within 5 minutes of us pressing the call button. Our food was hot and came quickly. Wasn't busy either times that I've visited."

We were a few minutes early but were seated immediately. \n\nI had the Blackened Heart of Ribeye topped with herb blue cheese butter. On the side were fingerling potatoes (cooked in duck fat) and asparagus. It was out of this world, and the potatoes were off the chain!\n\nMy wife had Just for the Halibut. The Halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers, spinach, and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc.\n\nShe loved it, although her spinach was a bit sandy. \n\nWe didn't have room for desert, but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake.  Also off the chain! I am typically a fan of dense cheesecake... this is not, but the flavor was amazing."

We were still dressed in our wedding attire and were treated like a king and queen. We were greeted with complimentary valet parking, kindly welcomed by the wait staff, and ate the best steaks we've ever had (and by best, I mean my wife's well-done steak was still flowing with juices). Kevin gave us outstanding service, even giving us a free dessert to take home out of his own pocket. We could not have had a better dining experience on our wedding night. Many thanks to Del Friscos!!"

It was very noisy, TVs were everywhere it seemed and there obviously was no dress code. I did not see any of the usual wait staff, most seemed new and inexperienced for a quality establishment. The entrees: poor quality meat, over seasoned and undercooked. One of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order. The waiter barely graced our presence, never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated. After we ordered the lemon cake , he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill. Just a note on your signature dessert- stale, hard and crusty...at least a few days old. We did speak to the manager about the terrible experience. He quickly became defensive, perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed."

It turned out to be one the worst decisions that I made in my life. First of all, I was treated rudely by the front-desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there. Well, I admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places, but I still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several Spanish-speaking dudes who were checking out before me, and who were clearly pointing, looking, and making fun of me... However, I wouldn't give the place 1-star just for that reason alone. On top of that, the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago. I even found a hair in my eggplant, and ended up throwing away about half of the food. I will NEVER come there again. A good thing is that I don't even live anywhere remotely near this place."

I'm okay with this kind of wait but my preconceived notion was to expect a Panara sub 5 minute meal. Definitely worth it and didn't subtract from my experience.  I wish that there were locations in my part of the country as I would definitely eat at them."

As a waitress you get paid $2.13 hourly.

Our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we're crazy and told US that the table was clean. We had to ask 3 times for them to clean, but it was only grudgingly. Our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum. For some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3' straw thin  French fries it was not worth the time nor the money. \nPutting up with it due to the inclement weather, we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house. This of course, infuriated us more. How a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me."

At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it.

This was probably the only bad thing.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked and the waitress came by every ten minutes to ask about our drink orders, which we finally placed. This was our fault, she was just doing her job.\n\nAnother hour goes by and we finally place our meal order, which included pizzas and different Italian dishes. The food came rather fast and, I can't speak for my friends, but my pizza was cooked perfectly, made-to-order. It was hot and fresh and gooey and oh-so-good.\n\nBy the time we finished our talking, we had realized that the restaurant had actually CLOSED DOWN around us, and we were there at least a half hour after closing. The staff never mentioned it though, which was super-nice and accommodating. I would've expected them to kick us out, which they didn't.\n\nSo overall, great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices too- two pizzas were just $12 + tax and tip."

We had to ask for a bucket of ice to get it cool enough to drink. \n\nRich sauce, doughy bread, and everyone gets about a pound of spaghetti--enjoy the leftovers!"

No utensils for items there i had to let the people know not only did they not replace the food that im quite sure customers were sticking their hands in to get they just but utensils in them. I watched a server fan her face and hair with customers to go containers and then deliver a customers plate of food with a floor cleaner in her hand as well. Returned my order and had to wait 20 mins to get my replaced order. After waiting my and my boyfriend just left. Nasty customer service and nasty servers. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EAT.

We have to ask for everything and she is ALWAYS in a rush and seems overwhelmed every time we go.... We usually sit in the bar part and she always served us but switched to the restaurant part and yup, it was HER AGAIN...... FOOD IS GREAT but server is absolutely horrendous ....

The food was not good for the price, the chicken salad was boring, the bread was old and stale. The sweet potato mash was watery, stringy and bland. If this restaurant was not a 501C3 designation I would have refused to pay the food was that bad. I don't know if it because I'm a single woman I got treated so badly or what. I can only compare my treatment to the man sitting 1 chair down from me. Sadly I will no longer be recommending this business to my friends and family nor will I be returning."

All the other food is great as well and it's a  great place to try new dishes including fried chicken skin nachos, rocky mountain oysters, etc. The drinks are phenomenal as well, especially their Moscow mule. Warning though, if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait up to an hour, possibly two, for a table inside. I will say though, it's more than worth the wait."

There are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine (but I didn't have enough room to sample). With all of this, there are also simple kebab options, and dip options. Then there's the sushi bar and menu. Yes, eclectic.

Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).

The hostess was very polite.  She told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time.  Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.  I would never leave no tip even with horrible service.  I am very disappointed.  I know $9 is not a lot of money to some but again I did NOT authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill."

With that said, the ribs are the best. I can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all. Why? Well it's not because I'm a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite. 5'9, 150. It's because the ribs are so good that I am not even thinking about how full I am. The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is insane. And throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and I am happier than a pig in... Do yourself a favor and get the ribs!!

Great breakfast all day items and I love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items. Love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly. Service and professionalism need improvement. \n\nOn a recent visit, we sat outside (brought the dog; bad idea; July heat) and waited 5-10 minutes before receiving water (repeat... July heat) or menus. Not a great start...but OK. We then proceeded to sit for another 50 minutes before receiving our food.  \n\nThough the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant, the kitchen performance was also spotty...  Parts of the meal were freshly made; other items (ie biscuits and gravy) had heavily congealed; revealing it had sat ready for SOME TIME before it was served. Lines happen and kitchens get backed up; this is not the issue. I will wait for good food; just don't make me wait and then serve bad food.\n \nThe server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server.

It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told 'We're out of that souffl\u00e9. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.' I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffl\u00e9 so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund. This is the SECOND time I've had an issue with this location. I won't return but I suggest you fix it soon, Panera"

I have a job in the food industry for about 4 years so I know what's it like to not be able to attend to a customer right away but when your being ignored right in front of your face is a different story. Honestly I would recommend the food to anyone but if your going there looking for good service you should just turn around and walk out the door."

The waitress seemed like she had never waited tables before. We were brought water after a table that sat down after us did. The waitress told us the specials, but when we went to order, found out that 1/3 of the menu was not available because they were out. She did not offer substitutions or other options, which we heard her give other guests. The food was barely average, and the grits notably came out barely warm. The ham was over salted, and my fiance's omelet special with 'ham' had no ham in it. We will be moving to this area soon, and will likely not return to The Liberty."

To my surprise all they did was reheat the plate and put it in a to-go container since I was on lunch break and did not have time to eat. \n\nI usually do not write reviews but in this case I want to make sure others do not have to experience this kind of service. \n\nAfter all of the inconvenience,  I still received the check.

After a wait of almost 30 minutes the waitress comes over and states they had to redo the wings.  Five minutes later the manager comes over with the gumbo and says here's something to munch on while you wait for the wings (I wanted it to come out WITH the wings).  No real apology was offered just another long wait for wings....and the order was STILL wrong.  \n\nWe ordered charred wings in two different flavors.  Came out plain and flavorless.  Staff seemed to be irritated when it was brought to their attention.  Manager brought out two bowls of sauce that should have been cooked on the wings and said 'here try this'!!\n\nI'm not going to go into the fact of having to ask for extra napkins as well as tea refills.  There definitely needs to be some training of staff at this location.\n\nA word to the wise spend your hard earned money some where else."

        "Review": "This review relates only to the Annual Oyster Feast.  We attended the 3rd annual one on October 2nd, 2014.\n\nPrice per head was $95.  Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.\n\nThe oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.\n\nOther selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)\n\nAfter about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.\n\nOverall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."

So here we have a placid, peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled, rammed head first into the floor, laid on top of, once again with hugely excessive force. The whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance. He was then picked up by a second security staff, the two thugs combining to ram his head into a pillar as he was removed from the premises, comolete with a split head and very very confused to what had happened. Disgraceful security, and the manager when asked to be spoken to was not interested at all, obviously supporting thuggery more than friendly business. Huge regrets for spending any of my hard earned money here."

Neither are what I consider dinner atmosphere. The menu is such a hodgepodge of food. We thought with the name 'Lure' we were going to have a great seafood selection, we were wrong. The Blue Point oysters we ordered were mushy. Hard pass. And the calamari were boring and cold. Pass on these, too. And that's when we decided we should just cut our losses and head somewhere else. The wait staff is nice and helpful. Bless their hearts.  \n\nIn short, are they a seafood resturant? A diner? A pool hall? A club? I'm not sure and don't think I will be back to find out."

I want to walk away from that feeling like 'That was incredible and I can't wait to go again'. That is not even close to what we felt. We got the 'newbie' waiter, so the service was not top notch. We were told the special came with a white wine sauce, only to overhear another waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce. Sure enough, it came out with a red sauce. If the price of the meal was in the $60 range I might not be so critical. But when you pay what I consider to be a pretty pricey cost...add to that the fact that the $9 glass of wine came from an $8 bottle (it was good wine, but I don't need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction), I would say it was just 'ok'. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth going back to when there are so many other great places in the area."

Since then, we've also celebrated my father-in-law's 70th birthday, complete with a gorgeous dessert tray seemingly prepared for a celebrity. We are grateful for the memories and the personal hospitality we receive at every meal. Family brunch, lunch date, drinks & apps, and of course dinner--all are fabulous reasons to dine at Bistro La Bon!"

He went over the beer sheets and the fact that Rock Bottom is a Brewery with brew-master Robb,  and all of their food is made from scratch by their head chef Korey. The Asiago crab dip was a great recommendation as well as the carrot cake for desert. Great suggestive selling. Our entrees were out in less than twenty minutes. We even had a couple of managers stop in periodically to check on us. I think their names were Nick and Kevin. Great guys. I am a mystery shopper by trade and always take notes on my visits.

Jordan brings us our drinks and a loaf of bread with pesto. Jordan also bring me a salad with some kind of NUT/Seed concoction. I saw the nuts on my salad and told him to take it away. He said they are not NUTs they are pumpkin nuts. While eating my salad my mouth started burning. I was having an allergic reaction. I didn't know why. I asked my husband to google pesto. Pesto has PINE NUTS in them. We told Jordan and he said that pesto at Bonefish Grill does not have NUT. I then asked for hot tea. My allergic reaction made me nauseated so I rushed home. When I googles Bonefish Pesto this morning this I what I found \n\n1 cup basil leaves\n1/4 cup Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup PINE NUTS\n2 garlic cloves, chopped\n1/4 tsp salt\n6 Kalamata olives\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nI think servers should be knowledgeable about the items they are serving. Even though it just made me sick, this could have been a death experience for someone. I will be contacting management when they open today"

The Hostess was dumbstruck when I asked how much longer. She said there were no guests waiting/unseated. She asked me 3 times for my name and number in my party. She finally told me to go into the bar and she would find a server. I'll quickly bullet the rest on the evening:\n- not given water after asking\n- received drinks 20 minutes after ordering\n- 1 refill required extreme effort and 1 hour\n- food was cafeteria quality\n- server was superficially smiling but obviously perturbed\n- drunk panhandler was greeted by the barmaid by name. Larry then proceeded to ask table after table of diners for gas money. 4th table complained to the barmaid who finally asked Larry to leave.\n- salad refill never arrived.\n\nPreviously 3 stars:\nAsk for Server Lynette.

But when you ask for a Jager Bomb or an Irish Car Bomb, then I think their  respective shots should drop/bomb into the drink.  In theory, that would happen if the shot was in..say...a shot glass.  They served the shot is a plastic medicine cup.  That makes it difficult to drink/bomb/enjoy.  The shot was just floating in the pint glass.\n\nDoes anyone remember Exxon Valdez?  Plastic is made of oil, and oil floats.\n\nAlso, one more thing.   The music is so damn loud, that I can't hear myself think about how loud the music is.  \n\nI understand...It tries to be classy, what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels, like a posh NYC night club...but this is a bowling alley.\n\nAn Alley."

It wasn't until later that i was treated very poorly. maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior i've incounter is unacceptable. I would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out. I was patient until I realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress. As a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking. (but of course thats just me) \nSecond, when my family & i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the 'kitchen was close' and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half  before closing time but even then that didn't much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it wasn't until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me .. they refuse to serve my family & i but served them no questions asked? I THINK NOT .. an apologe was not even giving to us. \nThirdly, the  DJ is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song. I as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee. As an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj .. \nThis resturant is a disappointment big time.  I would be damned if i step foot here again. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime!."

Our server was M.I.A.for the majority of my time there. Beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time. Bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer. Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."

I was standing right next to her, and after repeated comments like this, I'd heard enough and said, 'hey man, the girl lost her keys, and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here, what is your problem?' He immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me 'What the f***k are you going to do about it?' (something I don't think was necessary, at all, at this point). He proceeds to call over security who says, 'Hey let's talk about this over here' (pointing to a spot away from the bar). I agreed saying, 'yes, let's talk about it' (after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt, by an overly aggressive bar tender).

Atmosphere was great, prices were fair, wait wasn't long. The pulled pork was great. The brisket..... Well, to be honest it was some of the worst I've ever had. Mac and cheese was below avg compared to most of the other BBQ places I've been. The place was worth going one time, I'm not sure it did enough for me to come back any time soon."

        "Review": "Been waiting forever to try this place. In all honesty, I'll have to try a regular plate for a more unbiased opinion. To rate the food, it was 4/5. Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

        "Review": "Stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament.  My biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside (which I told them about several times) and the laundry/cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived (after 6pm).  In general, they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff.  But our room was clean, so that is good.  This is your typical Hyatt Place, so if you are familiar with the brand and layout, you know what to expect.  The lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast, but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful.  This hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators (which are in the hallways right behind the front desk, also used for access to/from the lobby and other rooms).   This was definitely a problem during high traffic times, you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators.  Very poor layout in my opinion.  Otherwise, the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a Hyatt Place, so if you like the layout it will be the same.   I really like the sitting area, it's quite large and has a big L-shaped sofa and a separate desk.  Really nice!   The only thing I don't like about these rooms is the 'open' bathroom area.  The sink is basically in the bedroom so it's very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready (like brushing your teeth) without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping.   But if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time, no problem.\nNegatives: Small lobby and breakfast area (cramped if busy), overflowing trash cans outside, a lot of laundry/cleaning carts in hallways, very cramped elevator location.\nPositives: Large rooms, new, modern, room was clean and quiet."

There are also two computers with Internet access and a printer available downstairs, for free, also 24/7. The staff are friendly and the rooms were clean. There are plenty of television downstairs to lounge and watch. It was a great experience with kind and friendly staff."

I think that this place has potential,but I think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out and the mini market.  The pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to. There was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored,but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms. That did not make a difference. The pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do."

        "Review": "First, I would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job. Lucy, is an angel. It meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea. I know grandma CAN do it herself, but we encourage her to let us help her.  For anyone that looks after someone who has needs, the little things mean the world to people who take care of them. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. \n\nHowever, Hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people. It is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people (especially at night), as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped.  Bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location.\n\nThere was some confusion or miscommunication about the room I had booked. I booked a two bed room, and what I received was a one bed room with a pull out couch. The other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed. Truth be told, I was not stoked to sleep on the floor on Friday for $140 a night. However, we were able to move rooms on Saturday. \n\nHyatt! Spend the money and supply your staff team!\n\nHotel policy's are a 'hit and miss'.  What I mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay, but be charged for it another time. \n\nThere is apparently a $30 'damage fee' to cover any hotel property if ruined.  I was not charged this fee before, so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill. However, the kind desk manager, Joel, was able to remove it. \n\nThis is my second time at this hotel, and both times I had my dog. The first time I was not charged $75 (even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file). For the record, the dog is well behaved.  When I asked the manager (name?) about it, he simply told me that it was policy. I told the manager I understood, but if there if a policy, follow through with it at all times. He removed it, but honestly, the money didn't matter. It is more important that I can be informed.  I was frustrated. I felt like I was being  'dismissed' from the conversation by having the charge dropped. I want to be informed so I am prepared for the charge on my bill. \n\nBottom line, if you have a policy, follow through with it at all times. Inconsistency kills a business. I do not like to be surprised with 'fees' I was not informed of, nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel. \n\nI don't get to see my family as often as I like since I took a job in Florida, so these trips are special to us. I chose Hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends. I chose this particular location due to other customer reviews. My first visit compared to my last visit was night and day. \n\nWhen I left, I felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel. I am a client who like to 'have it together' as far as reservations and what to expect. I set this trip up for my family, and I feel like I failed them. \n\nIt was good to see old friends and family during my visit, but the hotel was not a nice stay."

At one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well. We probably won't come back to Sports Connection next time for our group bowling. The staff was great! But the lanes need some serious TLC. When you're paying per hour, it's frustrating to continually loose time waiting for the lanes to get fixed. Again, great staff!

Can't decide?...get the fish and chips and beef on 'weck combo every Sunday. Great patio right on East, where you can relax with a cold drink and watch the world go by.

Then the salty bacon, the sweet jd's BBQ sauce paired with a medium flavor cheese and a salty crispy onion ring gave me something I was not expecting...pure mouth joy. The semi floppy  (requested) chips had this seasoning (salty, peppery sweet) that were amazing, too.

The hostess, Juliana, was very pleasant and helpful as I was traveling from Columbia for dinner. After being seated at 7:15 on Monday evening, it wasn't until 7:45 before we had our drinks. We reluctantly had to ask the hostess to put in our appetizer orders. We had the Yellowfin tuna tartare and the charcuterie board which were well balanced and flavorful. Yet, it was still a constant struggle for service. \n\nOur server got our entree orders wrong and failed to bring out our 2nd round of drinks after multiple times of us requesting them. He also didn't come see us after we received our meal so I didn't get to eat what I ordered. I had the 10oz filet with bordelaise, which had fantastic flavor and texture - the bordelaise was a perfect accompaniment. To no surprise, paying the bill was just a difficult. \n\nTo my knowledge, the restaurant was launching a new menu tonight, which, understandably, could be problematic for some servers. The problem was that we routinely saw our waiter pass us to help out the other tables around us, yet he repeatedly neglected to attend to our table. I expect more in terms of service when I pay $120 for a dinner for two. It pained me to even leave a decent tip. The food, on the contrary, was phenomenal - which is why I gave the rating 2 stars. The interior had a very upbeat and lively atmosphere."

The Wagyu steak was good, but I could do better for cheaper.  Another dish we were served was barely-cooked vegetables.  Everyone was appropriately apologetic, but due to the slow service and limited vegetable options, we had to just leave it.  My recommendation to the place?  Less expensive fancy cuts of meat and more attention to the easy details -- like cooking vegetables!\n\nIf you want to try something new in Charlotte, you might want to move this one down the list til they can sort their kitchen issues."

Good amount of crab and a great hush puppy batter with a house made tartar blend. I had the mammoth burger with everything and the house made pimento cheese. Burger was cooked excellent however I wish they had given a little more pimento. I couldn't taste the cheese on the burger. I had two absolute peppar bloody Mary's and they were the best I've had in a long time. We will definitely be returning frequently!"

They were able to fit about 40 of us in the patio area and kept up with our drink and dinner orders,  there wasn't anything I ate (provided food... we didn't see the regular menu) that really made me say I needed to come back.

The Mac and cheese was okay (better to look at than eat) and I ended up too full for desert, but did sneek a chocolate covered berry, lol.

We ordered medium steak and shrimp for dinner, stuffed mushrooms and a salad. We watched at least 10 different tables get their food before we did. This made us furious. Our waitress was pleasant and tried her best to figure out what the problem could've been. Even the manager had no excuse for this very poor customer service. When the food finally did come I wasn't even able to enjoy it. The food was not worth it. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20"

The bar was fine if you get a seat away from the front door. They have a neat fish tank and the bartender was attentive to drinks and food which was nice. If you like hot tea I would highly recommend getting a pot of their hot tea. It is delicious and some of the best tea I have had. I'm not a big burger fan so I've only stuck with the sushi here. They have some nice combinations and some good options if you want to stay away from anything fried (although fried anything is so good).  My favorite so far is the tropical storm roll because it comes with a decent amount of fish and a nice sauce. If you want an appetizer, the tuna-Tini is really good and is a pretty good portion.  Good food, good atmosphere."

Knew it would be busy but we were in no hurry and the weather was great. All was going fine until we received our food. I ordered a chicken sandwich and the presentation was nice and the fruit salad was beautiful. However the chicken was undercooked and disgusting, completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick. The texture!!! I know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it. I hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked. He looked at it and insisted it was fine, that it's how the cook it on the flat top or something like that. He did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all- just snatched my plate up and walked away. I sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes. He completely ignored me for the rest of the meal, as if I had done something wrong. I noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so I guess they figured all was settled. But I take poor service and lack of pride in serving edible meals to be a big deal. I won't be returning to this establishment ever again."

Nobody came to take our drink order; nobody even looked at us. There were empty tables everywhere and the wait staff didn't seem to be busy as the lunch rush was just wrapping up.

I visited Chima last week with some friends and I would say that if you are hungry for some good food and enjoy good customer service then you should visit them soon. The experience was good from the moment you walk into their beautiful establishment. Greeted with warm smiles and hostesses eager to take care of your needs. The mood is nice with the dimmed lights and soft music. The service is good. No waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress. Orders are there in a timely manner, and table is cleared almost instantly. The meat is circulating around like clockwork and is always hot and juicy with flavors that melt in your mouth. Their salad bar features many different options of salads from Mixed Greens to Pasta salads. It also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice. At the table, they bring many different side dishes, which is something I haven't experienced at a Brazilian Steak House before. Even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one. I did however, had an issue with the valet parking I didn't get as stated on their website(update site with start time). My waitress did send a manager my way, he explained the rule(law) that the states has about valet parking(knowledge) and even offered to split the cost for the parking deck payment. I was all smiles after that. I left Chima  happy, stuff and could barely walk but satisfied with the outcome overall. Chima, you will see me again. Thank you for a wonderful evening.By the way, try the Brazilian soda called Guarana Antarctica...SO GOOD"

When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve."

My wife was in regular shoes and not participating in any ice skating activities but was still injured. Management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not 'being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities'. I was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an 'activity'. This should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas. Accidents are very likely to happen during crowded times if this is not mandated."

A basic franchise like Wing Stop has better wings and also Hickory Tavern with their old bay wings. Hopefully this can be fixed."

Over the last year I have had three different times that I have ordered and have had to call to find out where the pizza is. Instead of the manger trying to help with their screw up they have hidden behind there staff. As someone who does customer service for a living this is not how you handle it.  I understand things happen. It's how a company handle those challenge is a sign of the company . With managers like this no wonder this  store seems to have so many problems."

The atmosphere is fancy enough that you can impress a date but casual enough that you two won't feel out of place if you come in jeans and use a salad fork for your entree.\n\nThere isn't one mean server in the house. They are all friendly (Robbie is the best!) and I'm always impressed with how well they know the menu. I'm not a huge drinker so I'm always ordering virgin drinks. I've never had a non alcoholic drink that didn't taste like a cool spring breeze lol (Rachel is the bartender I like). \n\n You don't wait long for food, it comes out exactly when it should. Speaking of food, I rate it a ten. \n\nTop 3 Apps\n- Aria Caesar Salad (keep the anchovies, I promise they work really well with it. I used to be a no anchovies kinda girl too)\n- Gnocchi (the appetizer, I haven't tried the spinach gnocchi entree yet)\n- SHAVED KALE SALAD!!! PERFECTOOOOO!!\n\nTop 3 Entrees\n- Spaghetti and Meatballs\n- The steak is awesome, if you have a little money to blow.\n- FETTUCCINE CARBONARA! add blackened shrimp and thank Robbie for the bomb suggestion.\n\nBest dessert award goes to the Blackberry Cheesecake! Hands down! \n\nMake sure you get a cappuccino and ask Dennis (the hottest guy ever) for some whipped cream. Thank me later ladies. :)\n\nBottom line, Aria rocks! Great food, great music, and the greatest service ever. Make a reservation if you can because they do fill up fast some nights, even though I never make one and always get a table (but it's purely good luck). Make sure you try the bread, cause Lorrrrdddddd it's the best."

This is one of those restaurants, tucked in to a small unit in a shoping center, that only locals know about.

I immediately asked for a manager who didn't seem concerned about my problem.  After that my other niece was brought out Chicken fried steak which she ordered Chicken fried chicken.  Once again the manager came out totally unconcerned about the mishap. My \n order I placed to go was to have no dressing on the salads but on the side so my salads wouldn't get withered quickly.  However that's not what I received. My table remained full of glasses and plates while my waitress gabby was not listening to my concerns.  She was very short and rude with my family.

Next time it sent back the owner John brought it out and this time it was done right. But it turned into a 3 couse meal. I eat my salad. then I had my vegetables, low and behold had a steak last. The week before that I was in around 6pm and ordered Salmon and the middle was raw, raw. I was eating at the Lucky Texan about 3 times every two weeks. I have now switched to Outback on Independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks. Steaks excellent , service good. John, owner of TRH should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge match. Owner should be a little more humble and not act like the customer in the wrong. He never apologized to me so I took it that he did not care if I came back. Did not penalize the server, always tip because I know it is not the server. Thanks John, I am getting my steak cooked properly."

As you walk in you are expecting a server to come and sit you down because of the linen tables, no one come we stood there for about 10 mins, the cashiers were behind the counter and didn't acknowledge us. (this is the first time we came to this place) We looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order, when our food came out she didn't bring out the fries we had ordered (which you have to pay 1.99 extra for) we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we weren't getting them. We started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way, the plantains weren't cooked either and the rice was COLD. It was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us, because they were closing, as I was filling up my drink I noticed that they were just re-heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator.

The server argued and said the Chef said it had lobster. Fyi my family is from Maine and knew there was no lobster. The crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought. When we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold. The peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream.

The grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges. If that wasn't bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate. It was so overbearing I couldn't taste the potatoes or the collards. I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that I wanted and i said no just take it off the bill. Now since this restaurant is listed as an 'upscale' restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was. Well I guess not as no one came so i guess they don't really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket. We also had a 'cup' which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp & lobster bisque and there wasn't a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty. We paid the bill but since they don't seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again. on the way home I was reading their reviews and wished that I had done that before going as there were many bad reviews.\n\nVisited January 2016"

If you want a quick place to eat with mediocre food and service, by all means, try this place out."

        "Review": "Much has been written about 'Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop' in local print and web publication so we, as a family, decided to give it a try over Father's Day weekend. Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

I was told by the blond hostess she could not accommodate a large party outside in the shade. She offered us a table inside or suggested we wait until it became cloudy. I had to ask.. When did she think it would be cloudy? Lol. Anyways I told her no thank you, I will come back when it's cloudy. I was not impressed. Now after reading some of these reviews I am happy we went elsewhere. My suggestion to groups of more than two..go elsewhere."

My wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it. The waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay. She replied that it wasn't to her liking that it was very dry, bland and not very good at all. The waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes. He removed the dish from the table. He didn't even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal. We will never eat at this restaurant ever again. My advice would be to look elsewhere for Mexican food. There's much friendly and delicious Mexican restaurants out there."

        "Review": "This is definitely a restaurant with a brewery attached, not a brewery. If you're trying to eat here on a budget... don't. That's the best advice, I suppose.\n\nAim away from peak hours, for better service, and I personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles, especially for the price - I'm not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up Fried Chicken, but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing, and the waffle was nothing special. To make matters worse, it was served vertically, on a spike, without any clear way to approach it.\n\nI'm rambling. My general view of the menu is that it's focusing too much on being gourmet, and not enough on being... well, GOOD. Another reviewer got it spot-on - the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas.\n\nGreat and (slowly) rotating selection of Belgian and farmhouse style beers, one of the better places for the style in Charlotte if that's what you're into (which is what earns it the third star), but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd that's used to the city's higher-end dining and nightlife. If you've got money to burn on food or mixed drinks, or you're just here for the beer, you could do worse than a night at Heist."

There were at least 5 people working back in the kitchen -- I know because I finally had to go to the kitchen counter to ask to pay my bill so I could leave. Who has 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a salad lunch with a glass of water? The buffalo chicken on my salad consisted of 4 nuggets dipped in sauce. Oh, and to top it off I was charged full price for a kid's meal, which is an advertised special to be free on Tuesdays! I did not have my wits about me to compute that until I had already paid and left. So $44 for 2 adults and one kid to have lunch, including a 10% tip I gave the server purely as a courtesy. Between the food and the service it was barely worth half of that. Too bad to see this place go downhill with no attempt to make things right or compensate the customer."

Been all around different  cities and states to try different dimsum restaurants and have to say this place had some of the best dimsum we have ever had especially their Hong Kong duck!  Their dimsum tasted fresh unlike most that taste like it's been sitting in the freezer or fridge.  The duck was definitely melt in your mouth.  Great service as well!"

I thought I had experienced a variety of Asian foods until I ate lunch at the Dragon Court.  This restaurant offers a nice family environment with a majority of Asians supporting the establishment.  Dragon Court is truly ethnic, offering the real deal.  Loved the food and environment.  Although the restaurant is located in an old shopping center with a pot hole ridden parking lot, you tend to forget about this after entering the Dragon Court because they offer  a clean environment. and great service.  I just wish I could find a similar restaurant in Georgia."

Besides other food, 3 in our group ordered gumbo,  2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo.\nThe food came out shortly after placing our orders.  \nIt was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix-up on the gumbos.  The person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa.  As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was 'yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time' .  WHAT?  Unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind.  \nSorry, Razzoo's Cajun Cafe, this could have been a much better review since the food itself was actually fairly good, but this kind of mistake is inexcusable."

The decor and theme is well put together and the lighting is very dim especially at night, and at that time it's best to get a window seat. Satisfied with my meal and service but i believe they need more alcoholic drinks and portions for the price."

The only positive comment I can make is that they are consistent; consistently horrible. The product I have been handed has probably matched my actual order 10% of the time - that is, the odds of the employees doing their jobs correctly is 1 in 10. Knowing this, do not be surprised if you are handed McDonalds. I will never return to this location and I suggest others avoid it as well."

At the time there was just 4 of us, later it became 11. When it came time for the bill, just about everyone's was incorrect. After writing out what some of us should have on our bill they still messed it up! It took over 30 minutes before they got it 'right'. As compensation another waiter half heartedly gave some of us a voucher for a drink or app (no manager stopped by to apologize). After it was all said and done they still charged me for 2 tickets after reassuring me that the wrong one would be refunded. Such a shame the servers can't figure it out since the food and drinks were great."

But the overall experience was unacceptable. First of all, there wasn't a lot of customers. There were maybe 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. The waitress acted as if she didn't want her job. I had to remind her 3 times that I wanted lemon with my water. We ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay. I mean come on! It's water and tea. Any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty. The waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down. She did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was OK. It seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary. Any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers. This lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay. She then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us. We were given a review card before leaving. The experience was OK but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot! My boyfriend and I believe in tipping excellent customer service. Well this lady didn't deserve a cent of the tip I left."

Trust me, the Optimator tastes much better on draft, along with the rest.  I've never left this place hungry, and I've yet to be disappointed with the food or service after going here for the past 15 years or so.  Be warned, German beer is not Miller lite.  If you're drinking a liter or more, make sure you're not driving.  Pretzel bread, there is none better.  Also, much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in Charlotte, for both food and beer.  Most of what I prefer is between $15 and $20, but there are also some worthwhile options in the low to mid twenties."

Average dinner entr\u00e9e seems to be $17.\n\nMy salmon was perfectly done; most evenly cooked I'd ever had at a restaurant. The almond rice was fantastic in the reisling sauce from the salmon. The Wurstplatte was as expected, and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different. \n\nThe Heisse Liebe desert (vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce & 'Peach Schnapps,' topped with homemade whipped cream) was incredibly flavorful, while the Apfelstrudel was understated but better than many."

I have to say the service was spectacular, and the server really presented everything well.  I of course had to have the steak, it was really good - when I asked them to do it medium, it actually WAS medium - not medium rare, etc.  Really well done.\n\nMy one complaint is that the floor space seemed slightly cramped but really not overly so, it gets a bit noisy for a place of this caliber, but short of that, it was an excellent experience.  We will definitely be back again, there is really little they can do to make it better than it is."

She rudely told us that we are sitting on a table that she wanted to clean. My husband asked her what she want us to do and she said annoyed  ' Well nothing I guess I will have to wait on you now'. As we continue with our breakfast she kept walking around and looking at us like we are doing something wrong. Finally when we finished eating she came with the same attitude and told us that we need to take care of our plates. She was also complaining loudly about customers not having common sense, because they don't know where to throw their napkins. It was unpleasant experience and I won't go to that location any more."

The unfortunate thing was the kitchen manager was a part of the conversation. Out of this pack of buffoons there was one gentleman who attempted to correct is fellow coworkers. Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of 'ethnic names and poor accents' and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.  This behavior was not only culturally bias in nature but unprofessional, offensive and lacked customer service. Congrats, hates off to Panera for employing a great group of court jesters!"

My wife was given a rose by the hostess.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant was very nice.  Bob was our server and he was the BEST!  His recommendations were top notch!  We had an appetizer of Shrimp Cargot that was delicious!!!  For our meal we both had the Summer Fling ( Filet Mignon, Lump Crab Cake and Lobster Tail) along with the Grillied Asparagus and King Crab-Jalapeno Gnocchi.  Everything was perfect!!  Great flavors.  We ended the evening with two recommendations  from Bob.....S'mores Mousse Cake and Peanut Butter Black Bottom Pie which Bob brought out on a platter the had Happy Anniversary on it and two little candles.  \n\nWe have been to several restaurant's in and around the Charlotte area and Sullivan's has been the BEST so far!

I spoke to the manager Lyle.  He was rude, obnoxious and condescending.  He just kept saying we aren't allowed to take reservations.  I was simply trying to let him know we'd be a large party, so he could possibly seat others accordingly to be able to accommodate a large party (since restaurants have a limited number of tables they can push together.) I was appalled by Lyle's tone, and unwillingness to even listen.  My thought was....do I really want to patron a restaurant where the management is rude and has no customer service skills??  I then called the Mallard Creek location and spoke to their manager Robert.  My entire office goes there for lunch together frequently and Mallard Creek always accommodates us.  Robert was courteous and professional.  He said he would be happy to work with us.  I thanked Robert for his professionalism and told him how rude Lyle was to me. Upon arrival, our table was ready, our server was personable and awesome!  At the end of the night, I was informed that Robert was going to comp my meal to make sure we had a good time and nice experience. Hickory Tavern on E. Arbors Drive is our new location.  We will no longer patron Harris Corners because of Lyle's poor attitude."

Walking in you get the impression it's going to be a good time and then it all went south.\n\nWe sat at our table for at least 10 - 15 minutes with no one checking on us then the server showed up smelling like she had just smoked a carton with Joe Camel. She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me 'fries with that'....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.\n\nPlaced our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. \n\nOur order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.\n\nAgain the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing. \n\nSo on the way out the door I mentioned this to the 'manager' and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service. I drop over $20 per person and all the guy could say was he would look into it. \n\nWon't be going back ever. There is a problem there and they don't care to fix it so I won't be back. I was warned before I went and didn't listen."

I got lucky, I needed a table for two, and the hostess offered to seat us despite a full reservation list, and she she kindly asked if we would mind if we needed to be finished by 8:30 (we were seated around 7).  I personally appreciated that, instead of being turned away.   We both ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the food came very fast, waitresses were constantly checking in, refilling drinks, and we were satiated and finished by 7:45.  I'd prefer a lunch sandwich here more than paying the same for a jersey mikes sub, which are pretty good, but not as good as what they serve here."

A lady in front of me is asking him which flavor of ice cream has caramel, he names off a ton, she decides, and pulls to the window. I drive up to the speaker at 8:59pm, wanting ONE donut, nothing fancy. Employee ignores me. I say hello, nothing. Say hello again, nothing. I drive around, lady already left with her order and employee is inside laughing. I complain to corporate and get a generic response from store manager. As a 21 yr retail manager, I know a generic response, I understand wanting to close on time, but the employee was just flat out rude."

The ramen and sushi are the best you will find in charlotte. Period. \n\nThey will not do take out for the ramen, the ramen will go mushy and cold they say and they are correct. I respect their pride for their work. \n\nIt is a small place that is sometimes packed, it can be slow to be seated, served, and to pay. Sometimes the server can be seen as rude, especially when they are busy. Thats just the way it is here. \n\nI personally think its a privilege to have sushi, ramen and other Japanese dishes of such quality available to me, so everything else is forgivable. \n\n90% of the time i have an awesome experience with the service at this restaurant.  100% of the time the food is great. \n\nIf you can set aside entitlement and just allow time for this place you will be in for a treat."

The steaks were cooked properly, and the sides were good. Dessert was alright, but to be honest we were full at that point. The experience wasn't terrible, but not great. With other chop houses in Charlotte, we won't be visiting Ruth Chris again."

The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's.

Most Indian restaurants serve dishes within a narrow range of flavors - a range that those of us who eat in the U.S. have grown accustomed and used to. It's familiar and perhaps a bit boring. Well, get ready for a new adventure if you go here. They have all the traditional dishes - but they come with a twist, a spice, a flavor, a sauce, that you likely haven't seen, smelled, or tasted before. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which was scrumptious. I can't remember what my wife had to eat, because I obsessed and cherished over my own so. But I do remember that she was very impressed. I personally think this place is magisterial in their Indian cooking. If you don't know what that means, I'll just say the cuisine here rocks. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Wish they were located in my hometown.  This one is an exception. You'll be in for a treat if you're in the mood for Indian food. We love this place & will continue to come back!!"

We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good. \n\nBruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.\n\nCalamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better fried calamari in other restaurant this one was no that good. \n\nAsparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it. \n\nFor my main course I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it. \n\nMare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cook perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk. \n\nThe service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection. But like I say the Mare saved the day."

Went down there for my daughter's birthday to celebrate and seemed like that they were doing us a favor by been in there. So we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and it's been months. Decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there. Waiter was rude and quick with his responses, he didn't bring everything we ordered form the the start. We had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like I was bothering him by asking. Than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks. When we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last night's leftovers. I know how hard the waiting staff work and I never have tipping less then 20%. But today is the first time I left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left $0.00 tip. If you want to eat here throw your money in the trash can out side and eat some grass on the side of the road and you'll have better experience."

Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

What a way to do business! \n\nIf you're looking for a late evening sandwich, I would suggest finding your way to this Gateway Subway.

I honestly don't feel she cares about customers and why if the restaurant was closed did I hear things in the back ground? It shouldn't be advertised that this place closes at 10:00 when that is not in fact true. I like their salsa Verde but honestly the service is not that great and 2/3 times my order is wrong."

I was disappointed lately, that the chicken marsala and piccata carry outs have very large pieces of meat that are not the way the dish is supposed to be.  I have had to slice the chicken breasts in half, lengthwise, to get a proper, tender cut of chicken.  Otherwise, they totally rock it!"

        "Review": "This would be a three star review, but the service just pushes it up to four - when it comes to the standard casual American dining, this is fighting with Cheddar's for the best spot in the University area, and O'Charley's is far more accessible. The food's good, especially for the price.\n\nI've had some inconsistencies, though - a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy, a couple of steaks that have been too well-done for the medium-rare I normally order. I wish there were more appetizing healthy options - the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted, and most of the best savory foods they have on offer are drowning in butter, but I suppose that's what you're going to get with this kind of restaurant. \n\nI always leave feeling full, and it always feels like I more or less got my money's worth - and the staff is really fantastic."

It looks great and is always clean. I noticed my table being cleaned as soon as I walked out the door. The employees are on top of that. The only thing it's lacking is booth seating. It's only got two booth tables in the entire place iirc. But that's a very minor thing that the rest of the experience more than makes up for"

From there, you can help yourself to the salad (and burger toppings) bar, get some extra  spud spice for your wedges, and top your gluttonous meal with a bit of [heated] Cheese sauce. After dinner you can treat the kids to a hand-spun milkshake or baked in house cookie, both which are delicious. Kids can also enjoy an arcade game or watch one of 5~7 TV's."

Most of them are married, so I guess they cannot be bothered to be nice to patrons.  This Hooters is old and out of date. Many other Hooters have been renovated. The overall atmosphere is that they are doing you a favor by serving you. \n\nI understand that Hooters will hire anyone now to be an equal opportunity employer, but some pleasant staff would be nice."

Maybe three nuggets of assorted chicken bits, but well outweighed by the other stuff.  Picture attached to my review.\n- I didn't get a beer menu until after I got my food.

Then tell her she might be right but he would know normally since he doesn't try the food.  Then he paraded around to the other staff in an obvious attempt to make a mockery of the situation.

Corn beef, carmelized onions, pepper jack and goat cheese topped with beer glaze...unbelievable! That pizza is worth five stars! One complaint -$6 pints!

Constantly running food to the wrong table and was very awkward. I do feel bad because it seems like he was just given the job without any training whatsoever. The trivia questions on trivia night were laughable. If you want to go somewhere that hosts Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader nights then this is your place. It would not have been so awful if our server was even around. We had 1 beer the whole night because our server was not present to even ask if we wanted another beer or refill on water. Food was mediocre at best. Good customer service can always make up for lackluster food but this was definitely not the case. Bad attitude among entire staff including management and all around disorganized. It's a shame because it's a great location."

The chocolate cake made up for the shrimp, though.

It turned out to be one the worst decisions that I made in my life. First of all, I was treated rudely by the front-desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there. Well, I admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places, but I still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several Spanish-speaking dudes who were checking out before me, and who were clearly pointing, looking, and making fun of me... However, I wouldn't give the place 1-star just for that reason alone. On top of that, the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago. I even found a hair in my eggplant, and ended up throwing away about half of the food. I will NEVER come there again. A good thing is that I don't even live anywhere remotely near this place."

Got a bottle of red and it was downright warm (felt like it was kept in a hot area of the kitchen). We had to ask for a bucket of ice to get it cool enough to drink. \n\nRich sauce, doughy bread, and everyone gets about a pound of spaghetti--enjoy the leftovers!"

I\u2019d rather get smaller portions and have the quality vs. quantity. The fried shrimp were the tiny baby shrimp with THICK batter. Not much shrimp substance to it. Clams same. I did not try the other food so that might be better? The sour cream and butter \u201csubstitute\u201d were all prepackaged. The potato was good and hot and the hush puppies were good too. The service was good so no issues there. I definitely  had a gut ache for few hrs after leaving~ lesson learned!"

        "Review": "I visited last month with some friends who were visiting from Georgia. They picked the place and I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical about Riccio's. After all, it's located in a middle-of- the-woods shopping center that I didn't even know existed!\n\n(Before I review, I must tell you that my little group of pals are VERY chit-chatty, and we can't stop talking.)\n\nThe waitress kindly sat us, all 5 of us, even though the biggest table they had was sat only 4 people. This was probably the only bad thing.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked and the waitress came by every ten minutes to ask about our drink orders, which we finally placed. This was our fault, she was just doing her job.\n\nAnother hour goes by and we finally place our meal order, which included pizzas and different Italian dishes. The food came rather fast and, I can't speak for my friends, but my pizza was cooked perfectly, made-to-order. It was hot and fresh and gooey and oh-so-good.\n\nBy the time we finished our talking, we had realized that the restaurant had actually CLOSED DOWN around us, and we were there at least a half hour after closing. The staff never mentioned it though, which was super-nice and accommodating. I would've expected them to kick us out, which they didn't.\n\nSo overall, great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices too- two pizzas were just $12 + tax and tip."

One gentleman was just brought his food and he immediately asked for his check, which didn't come for 10 min. Then when we went to pay, there was no pen to sign.

Here's the catch though, I never get anything else but the baby back ribs, with coleslaw and French fries. So to ask me about the rest of the menu is a complete waste of time. With that said, the ribs are the best. I can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all. Why? Well it's not because I'm a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite. 5'9, 150. It's because the ribs are so good that I am not even thinking about how full I am. The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is insane. And throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and I am happier than a pig in... Do yourself a favor and get the ribs!! On a side note, my wife last year ordered the catch of the day and she said it was good. Now she only gets the ribs. Nice servers and a nice looking, clean place too."

It doesn't seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest/customer even when it's not busy. It also doesn't have the 'sanitary' feel to it (sanitary grade 96.0). I noticed that not all the staff wear gloves/hair net/hat when handling food. Food it self doesn't look/taste fresh. I had the Noda salad for lunch and it tasted like it's been out all day. Great location - It seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee. However, based on my experience, I wouldn't order anything simply because I wouldn't wanna get sick. It's kinda like waffle house...if that makes any sense."

The place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters, exposed brick walls, eclectic light fixtures, and a peacock over the sushi bar. It is a bit loud, but the DJ spun music is good.\n\nThe food is a great collection of modern interpretations of regional classics in small plates to share. There are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine (but I didn't have enough room to sample). With all of this, there are also simple kebab options, and dip options. Then there's the sushi bar and menu. Yes, eclectic. But tasty and done well.\n\nCoctails are good, wine list is good, and the beer list seemed a bit short, but with more than enough liquors to make up for it. Probably the best bourbon list I've seen since we left Kentucky!"

All the other food is great as well and it's a  great place to try new dishes including fried chicken skin nachos, rocky mountain oysters, etc. The drinks are phenomenal as well, especially their Moscow mule. Warning though, if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait up to an hour, possibly two, for a table inside. I will say though, it's more than worth the wait."

Great breakfast all day items and I love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items. Love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly. Service and professionalism need improvement. \n\nOn a recent visit, we sat outside (brought the dog; bad idea; July heat) and waited 5-10 minutes before receiving water (repeat... July heat) or menus. Not a great start...but OK. We then proceeded to sit for another 50 minutes before receiving our food.  \n\nThough the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant, the kitchen performance was also spotty...  Parts of the meal were freshly made; other items (ie biscuits and gravy) had heavily congealed; revealing it had sat ready for SOME TIME before it was served. Lines happen and kitchens get backed up; this is not the issue. I will wait for good food; just don't make me wait and then serve bad food.\n \nThe server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server. Perhaps something to be dealt with behind closed doors?"

Ate at the Auntie Annies with Cinnabon, good eat. The tables we sat at across from them however were a it gross, sticky surfaces and crumbs but that's mall seating not specifically theirs. Small food court but they had a Taco Bell and Sbarro in there. 2 level mall, easily walked from end to end in under an hour if you don't go I'm any stores. It was air conditioned and overall clean. I would visit here again when in the area."

When I shopped at Northlake, it remember it having a Belk, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Macy's. Let me just say that the Macy's was a really clean store. Plenty of good clothing selection. Along with this, the mall's food court also had a diverse selection. The pizza spot there was very savory.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to shop. They had a Sweet Spot store inside which I of course got a lot of candy. They also had a Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, and an AMC. Very enjoyable mall. \n\n- Bryce B."

On Friday and Saturday evenings, the mall's main entrance closest to the AMC Theatre becomes an outdoor gang recruitment center complete with cars playing music so loud you can't hear yourself think.\nThis 'scene' has led to two separate shooting incidents in the last two years - though not on weekend nights.  This past Christmas one of those incidents involved a shootout with a Charlotte Police Officer who killed the thug.\n \nThe variety of stores is still good, although there have been several stores that left.  Johnston & Murphy Men's Shoes, a high end store, closed, Italian restaurant BRAVO Cucina Italiana closed, among others."

PROS - Food was VERY fresh and very flavorful; server was EXTREMELY friendly; reggae tunes were mellow and set the beachfront Caribbean atmosphere; & despite 90\u00b0+ temps the patio somehow attracted a nice breeze.

But the Charlotte Marriott City Center gets 2 HUGE strikes right now. Never again. I've been here twice and both experiences have been very negative. \n\nOne...the 'mobile key' app they so-hyped since I checked in is glitchy and not ready for prime time. I spent about 5 minutes standing at my door trying to get it to open my door to no avail. I got a message on my phone saying go to the front desk to get a physical key. Their explanation? 'Oh, sometimes it's a little iffy'. You know what? Don't promote it and hype it until it is solidly working. Having worked in IT and dealing with mobile apps...terrible execution. \n\nTwo...I don't like housekeeping in my room, due to past bad experiences. I always put the 'Do not disturb' sign on, and someone from the hotel even saw me put it up this morning and acknowledged it. In my 18 years of reserving rooms myself, I've never had anyone come into my room after putting the sign on, in any type of hotel. But it happened today. Now I don't know who took the sign off, but someone did and all my stuff is now rearranged and I am not happy. So Marriott...it's on you or your clientele."

The dumplings were delicious but I wish they had placed a few more on the plate. My entree came with the sushi roll we ordered and I felt like they didn't give me a proper portion. The rest of my friends had plenty of food filling their bowls, which were huge by the way. Who ever designed the menu really likes pineapple because almost every other item had pineapple in it. The sushi just didn't pan out like I was expecting it to. I know when dining in any city like Charlotte, food is going to be marked up. But, when that's the case, at least put some effort into it. The rice was too dry, and the vegetables in it were lacking their natural juices as well leaving the entire roll flavorless. Presentation was okay. It kinda looked like someone was in a rush when plating the sushi. Honestly you'd save more money and time going to Harris Teeter and grabbing some sushi and a bottle of wine. \n\nTL:DR\nSushi is better elsewhere and it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nAnd for God's sake, please get a new DJ. So many lame remixes of current pop songs set to an 80's bass track"

The themed neighborhoods are a nice touch and all of the stores are just as epic as the complex here itself.

You might as well get a night at a local hotel so you can come back the next day to explore the other half."

The halibut was dry and there was a tiny bit of slimy crab meat on top.  The lamb was chewy, but the mashed potatoes were good.  Not going back.  Disappointing."

On the side were fingerling potatoes (cooked in duck fat) and asparagus. It was out of this world, and the potatoes were off the chain!\n\nMy wife had Just for the Halibut. The Halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers, spinach, and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc.\n\nShe loved it, although her spinach was a bit sandy. \n\nWe didn't have room for desert, but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake.

It was very noisy, TVs were everywhere it seemed and there obviously was no dress code. I did not see any of the usual wait staff, most seemed new and inexperienced for a quality establishment. The entrees: poor quality meat, over seasoned and undercooked. One of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order. The waiter barely graced our presence, never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated. After we ordered the lemon cake , he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill. Just a note on your signature dessert- stale, hard and crusty...at least a few days old. We did speak to the manager about the terrible experience. He quickly became defensive, perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed."

I go to college for a reason and it's so I NEVER have to work in an environment like this, just TERRIBLE!!\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29"

I felt because i am not a regular they just sort of ignored me. I ordered  my burger med rare.  At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it. All and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut\u00e9ed spinach was good"

I said we know, you're still open for 1/2 an hour, no?  he started stuttering and a woman who I assume to be the owner, asks the host 'Is there a problem?'  She didn't give him a chance to answer back, cut him off and said 'Just let tthem know we close at 3 on the dot!\nHow rude is that?  talked as if we weren't there.\nzso I asked the host, so what happens at 3?  they pull the plate away from you and toss you out on the street?  He was actually contemplating an answer!\n\nExtremely rude and unwelcoming attitude. It hurt to pay $24 for the meal and  20% tip I felt they didn't deserve.  \n\nThe food was nothing to go home and talk about.  Guess the only reason they have a clientele is because they're the only breakfast place around."

Our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we're crazy and told US that the table was clean. We had to ask 3 times for them to clean, but it was only grudgingly. Our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum. For some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3' straw thin  French fries it was not worth the time nor the money. \nPutting up with it due to the inclement weather, we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house. This of course, infuriated us more. How a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me."

I was ignored for 12 minutes while waiting to pit in my order an older man came in 9 minutes after me and was seated, greater and his order was taken before mine. Finally I got to order. The food was not good for the price, the chicken salad was boring, the bread was old and stale. The sweet potato mash was watery, stringy and bland. If this restaurant was not a 501C3 designation I would have refused to pay the food was that bad. I don't know if it because I'm a single woman I got treated so badly or what. I can only compare my treatment to the man sitting 1 chair down from me. Sadly I will no longer be recommending this business to my friends and family nor will I be returning."

It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told 'We're out of that souffl\u00e9. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.' I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffl\u00e9 so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund.

Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).

Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.

Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.\n\nThe oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.\n\nOther selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)\n\nAfter about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.\n\nOverall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."

I just love that Ruby Tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce!  :)   They seated all 8 of us pretty quickly, service was good, and the food was consistent.\nPositives: Pretty good salad bar (they have spinach!), healthy side choices, consistently good food.\nNegatives: They were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky."

The Blue Point oysters we ordered were mushy. Hard pass. And the calamari were boring and cold. Pass on these, too. And that's when we decided we should just cut our losses and head somewhere else. The wait staff is nice and helpful. Bless their hearts.  \n\nIn short, are they a seafood resturant? A diner? A pool hall? A club? I'm not sure and don't think I will be back to find out."

Throughout my night there, in excess of thirty women were up on top of the speakers on the dancefloor dancing, which was absolutely fine and accepted by all staff. However, when a male friend of mine got up to dance he was told to get down and leave the venue. A huge double standard and very sexist. When another friend tried to peacefully reason with the secuirty staff, simplyto keep our friend in the venue he was suddenly, without warning put into a full headlock by the 230 pound staff member. So here we have a placid, peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled, rammed head first into the floor, laid on top of, once again with hugely excessive force. The whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance. He was then picked up by a second security staff, the two thugs combining to ram his head into a pillar as he was removed from the premises, comolete with a split head and very very confused to what had happened. Disgraceful security, and the manager when asked to be spoken to was not interested at all, obviously supporting thuggery more than friendly business. Huge regrets for spending any of my hard earned money here."

Specials most days of the week, and routinely there are special tappings or events with rare beers. If you like beer, and are in the University area, this should be your place to go.\n\nCome find me there. I'm the loud, bald, fat man there on Monday nights. Let's have a beer."

It was the most pathetic steak I have ever been served.  So, I broke two life records today.  Longest wait for a meal and worst steak ever.  $40.

The Asiago crab dip was a great recommendation as well as the carrot cake for desert. Great suggestive selling. Our entrees were out in less than twenty minutes. We even had a couple of managers stop in periodically to check on us. I think their names were Nick and Kevin. Great guys. I am a mystery shopper by trade and always take notes on my visits.

He said they are not NUTs they are pumpkin nuts. While eating my salad my mouth started burning. I was having an allergic reaction. I didn't know why. I asked my husband to google pesto. Pesto has PINE NUTS in them. We told Jordan and he said that pesto at Bonefish Grill does not have NUT. I then asked for hot tea. My allergic reaction made me nauseated so I rushed home.

I want to walk away from that feeling like 'That was incredible and I can't wait to go again'. That is not even close to what we felt. We got the 'newbie' waiter, so the service was not top notch. We were told the special came with a white wine sauce, only to overhear another waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce. Sure enough, it came out with a red sauce. If the price of the meal was in the $60 range I might not be so critical. But when you pay what I consider to be a pretty pricey cost...add to that the fact that the $9 glass of wine came from an $8 bottle (it was good wine, but I don't need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction), I would say it was just 'ok'. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth going back to when there are so many other great places in the area."

This is probably like the only restaurant that doesn't offer bread \ud83c\udf5e while you're waiting for food. The table were seated at didn't seem to be cleaned off well enough. Our drinks being served in beer mugs was unappealing. The waitress was nice but didn't know whether or not she would be our server \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude1e. So apparently after 20 minutes of we are served 2 very small cheddar cheese biscuts. They were good though."

        "Review": "Last night was a whole new bad experience.\nMy daughter wanted to treat me to dinner. The Hostess told us 1 hour wait and gave us the pager-puck. We waited outside because it was standing room only. 70 minutes later I returned to the hostess stand and noted there was NO ONE waiting other than us. The Hostess was dumbstruck when I asked how much longer. She said there were no guests waiting/unseated. She asked me 3 times for my name and number in my party. She finally told me to go into the bar and she would find a server. I'll quickly bullet the rest on the evening:\n- not given water after asking\n- received drinks 20 minutes after ordering\n- 1 refill required extreme effort and 1 hour\n- food was cafeteria quality\n- server was superficially smiling but obviously perturbed\n- drunk panhandler was greeted by the barmaid by name. Larry then proceeded to ask table after table of diners for gas money. 4th table complained to the barmaid who finally asked Larry to leave.\n- salad refill never arrived.\n\nPreviously 3 stars:\nAsk for Server Lynette. She's the best!\nAvoid the Talapia. I suspect seafood ain't generally their strong suit"

I did not have fun and am rather irritated that I paid $50 for 3 ppl to bowl in heat and on lanes that lean horribly. It's summer time, why is it so hot inside? Like my ball literally goes straight then sloughs off to the left towards the end. NEVER experienced that any other time I've bowled at other locations. A waste of my time and money. DISATISFIED!

The drinks themselves could be served better.  \n\nNow I'm not one to be a drink sob, when you wanna get a good buzz on, then serve is however you can.  But when you ask for a Jager Bomb or an Irish Car Bomb, then I think their  respective shots should drop/bomb into the drink.  In theory, that would happen if the shot was in..say...a shot glass.  They served the shot is a plastic medicine cup.  That makes it difficult to drink/bomb/enjoy.  The shot was just floating in the pint glass.\n\nDoes anyone remember Exxon Valdez?  Plastic is made of oil, and oil floats.\n\nAlso, one more thing.   The music is so damn loud, that I can't hear myself think about how loud the music is.  \n\nI understand...It tries to be classy, what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels, like a posh NYC night club...but this is a bowling alley.\n\nAn Alley."

Then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time, after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost. After not checking if the keys were turned in, and initially saying 'no', he began to respond with things like, 'it's not my f***ing responsibility if you lost your keys',  'I don't have your keys you f***ing stupid b**ch,' and 'stop giving me attitude about your keys' (when she clearly wasn't). I was standing right next to her, and after repeated comments like this, I'd heard enough and said, 'hey man, the girl lost her keys, and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here, what is your problem?' He immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me 'What the f***k are you going to do about it?' (something I don't think was necessary, at all, at this point). He proceeds to call over security who says, 'Hey let's talk about this over here' (pointing to a spot away from the bar). I agreed saying, 'yes, let's talk about it' (after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt, by an overly aggressive bar tender). Security proceeds to push me out a side door without saying a word. If this is the kind of bar you would like to go to, then I highly recommend it."

        "Review": "Ill give them the benefit of the doubt with the generous 3 star rating as it was somewhat busy and I did sit at a table I the bar area. Our server was M.I.A.for the majority of my time there. Beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time. Bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer. Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."

It wasn't until later that i was treated very poorly. maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior i've incounter is unacceptable. I would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out. I was patient until I realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress. As a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking. (but of course thats just me) \nSecond, when my family & i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the 'kitchen was close' and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half  before closing time but even then that didn't much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it wasn't until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me .. they refuse to serve my family & i but served them no questions asked? I THINK NOT .. an apologe was not even giving to us. \nThirdly, the  DJ is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song. I as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee. As an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj .. \nThis resturant is a disappointment big time.  I would be damned if i step foot here again. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime!."

Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

        "Review": "Stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament.  My biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside (which I told them about several times) and the laundry/cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived (after 6pm).  In general, they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff.  But our room was clean, so that is good.  This is your typical Hyatt Place, so if you are familiar with the brand and layout, you know what to expect.  The lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast, but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful.  This hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators (which are in the hallways right behind the front desk, also used for access to/from the lobby and other rooms).   This was definitely a problem during high traffic times, you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators.  Very poor layout in my opinion.  Otherwise, the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a Hyatt Place, so if you like the layout it will be the same.   I really like the sitting area, it's quite large and has a big L-shaped sofa and a separate desk.  Really nice!   The only thing I don't like about these rooms is the 'open' bathroom area.  The sink is basically in the bedroom so it's very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready (like brushing your teeth) without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping.   But if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time, no problem.\nNegatives: Small lobby and breakfast area (cramped if busy), overflowing trash cans outside, a lot of laundry/cleaning carts in hallways, very cramped elevator location.\nPositives: Large rooms, new, modern, room was clean and quiet."

At one point they switched one group to an entirely different lane and then the other lanes kept going down as well. We probably won't come back to Sports Connection next time for our group bowling.

I think that this place has potential,but I think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out and the mini market.  The pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to. There was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored,but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms. That did not make a difference. The pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do."

        "Review": "First, I would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job. Lucy, is an angel. It meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea. I know grandma CAN do it herself, but we encourage her to let us help her.  For anyone that looks after someone who has needs, the little things mean the world to people who take care of them. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. \n\nHowever, Hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people. It is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people (especially at night), as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped.  Bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location.\n\nThere was some confusion or miscommunication about the room I had booked. I booked a two bed room, and what I received was a one bed room with a pull out couch. The other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed. Truth be told, I was not stoked to sleep on the floor on Friday for $140 a night. However, we were able to move rooms on Saturday. \n\nHyatt! Spend the money and supply your staff team!\n\nHotel policy's are a 'hit and miss'.  What I mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay, but be charged for it another time. \n\nThere is apparently a $30 'damage fee' to cover any hotel property if ruined.  I was not charged this fee before, so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill. However, the kind desk manager, Joel, was able to remove it. \n\nThis is my second time at this hotel, and both times I had my dog. The first time I was not charged $75 (even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file). For the record, the dog is well behaved.  When I asked the manager (name?) about it, he simply told me that it was policy. I told the manager I understood, but if there if a policy, follow through with it at all times. He removed it, but honestly, the money didn't matter. It is more important that I can be informed.  I was frustrated. I felt like I was being  'dismissed' from the conversation by having the charge dropped. I want to be informed so I am prepared for the charge on my bill. \n\nBottom line, if you have a policy, follow through with it at all times. Inconsistency kills a business. I do not like to be surprised with 'fees' I was not informed of, nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel. \n\nI don't get to see my family as often as I like since I took a job in Florida, so these trips are special to us. I chose Hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends. I chose this particular location due to other customer reviews. My first visit compared to my last visit was night and day. \n\nWhen I left, I felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel. I am a client who like to 'have it together' as far as reservations and what to expect. I set this trip up for my family, and I feel like I failed them. \n\nIt was good to see old friends and family during my visit, but the hotel was not a nice stay."

Excellent service. The food was typical of general IHOP fair, no complaints. I believe there is an active plan in trying to rectify this restaurant's reputation."

Lets just say this place could do way better. Never in my years of serving and have I seen such unorganization! I always take pride in my work and always put my customers first. And I definitely always make sure my food goes out right. It's not cold always cooked to order and there isn't any hair in it either.I've had a couple ppl in the past tell me there was hair in it when I checked it before. I take a look at the hair and then look at their hair and see that the hair on the plate matches the hair on the persons head. People please stop putting your kinky hair on your plate to get free food!!"

I believe it was because the server was not particularly attentive to me (given that I asked specifically for what the specials were, I'm guessing they felt like it wasn't worth it to give me attention).  I never send dishes back to the kitchen, so no the restaurant did not get a chance to fix it."

Melissa Melvin 7/8/2016.\nORIGINAL REVIEW : DON'T believe any detractors of this location of this chain! We have been coming here for special occasions, entertaining out of town guests, and just because for several years. The service is superior and we have never experienced a long wait, plus the quality of the food is exquisite. The staff do not' hover' nor do they leave you lacking for anything. We gave up that 'other' Italian chain years ago - Carrabba' on South BLVD is the only place for Italian dining (except my own lasagna!)"

Wait was 10-15 minutes (only 1 person was ahead. They told him he had to wait about 5 minutes because they needed to clean some tables. Ridiculous) Food was horrible. The waitress was attentive. There was LOUDDDD laughing, cackling, screaming and talking coming from the kitchen. My silverware had dried on egg on it. My plate came with some red jam on my bacon and eggs (there was nothing on my plate that had any red jam on it). Food was disgusting. Went to use the ladies bathroom (the restaurant was dirty so I knew the bathroom would be too) , one of the stalls had blood all over the toilet and floor. It was just ridiculous all the way around.

He sent another server to our table that was just as ignorant as him. My daughters food was burnt to top off the other issues we had with the food and the manager never came to the table. He turned his head and went the other way. My daughter went to talk to him about how he acted, because she's a manager. She explained to him the issues we had and he walked away from her leaving her standing at the hostess area(front door).\n\nOur waiter Matt was great and apologized throughout the night.

Over all the quality of the food did not meet up to the cost of said food. Don't consider myself ever coming back."

Great food, decent wine selection for a local bar and the best staff on East Blvd. My regular eats here are the excellent chicken wings (try the Gold Rush sauce), the beef on 'weck (I haven't eaten this anywhere else so have nothing to compare it to, but it's excellent), the fish and chips (crispy batter, flaky haddock, fantastic). Can't decide?...get the fish and chips and beef on 'weck combo every Sunday. Great patio right on East, where you can relax with a cold drink and watch the world go by. Tuesday night is Trivia Night and it can be a little loud for talking, but it's not too bad if you sit at the bar."

The food was amazing!  The Jack Daniel's burger was insane. The burger had a flavor that was throughout the meat. Then the salty bacon, the sweet jd's BBQ sauce paired with a medium flavor cheese and a salty crispy onion ring gave me something I was not expecting...pure mouth joy. The semi floppy  (requested) chips had this seasoning (salty, peppery sweet) that were amazing, too. Friend had the fish tacos which he could not stop raving about paired with sweet potato fries, which were also really good. I look forward to my next trip."

        "Review": "This was my second time visiting 5Church; the experience was underwhelmingly satisfactory. The hostess, Juliana, was very pleasant and helpful as I was traveling from Columbia for dinner. After being seated at 7:15 on Monday evening, it wasn't until 7:45 before we had our drinks. We reluctantly had to ask the hostess to put in our appetizer orders. We had the Yellowfin tuna tartare and the charcuterie board which were well balanced and flavorful. Yet, it was still a constant struggle for service. \n\nOur server got our entree orders wrong and failed to bring out our 2nd round of drinks after multiple times of us requesting them. He also didn't come see us after we received our meal so I didn't get to eat what I ordered. I had the 10oz filet with bordelaise, which had fantastic flavor and texture - the bordelaise was a perfect accompaniment. To no surprise, paying the bill was just a difficult. \n\nTo my knowledge, the restaurant was launching a new menu tonight, which, understandably, could be problematic for some servers. The problem was that we routinely saw our waiter pass us to help out the other tables around us, yet he repeatedly neglected to attend to our table. I expect more in terms of service when I pay $120 for a dinner for two. It pained me to even leave a decent tip. The food, on the contrary, was phenomenal - which is why I gave the rating 2 stars. The interior had a very upbeat and lively atmosphere."

The Wagyu steak was good, but I could do better for cheaper.  Another dish we were served was barely-cooked vegetables.  Everyone was appropriately apologetic, but due to the slow service and limited vegetable options, we had to just leave it.  My recommendation to the place?  Less expensive fancy cuts of meat and more attention to the easy details -- like cooking vegetables!\n\nIf you want to try something new in Charlotte, you might want to move this one down the list til they can sort their kitchen issues."

The bar was fine if you get a seat away from the front door. They have a neat fish tank and the bartender was attentive to drinks and food which was nice. If you like hot tea I would highly recommend getting a pot of their hot tea. It is delicious and some of the best tea I have had. I'm not a big burger fan so I've only stuck with the sushi here. They have some nice combinations and some good options if you want to stay away from anything fried (although fried anything is so good).  My favorite so far is the tropical storm roll because it comes with a decent amount of fish and a nice sauce. If you want an appetizer, the tuna-Tini is really good and is a pretty good portion.  Good food, good atmosphere."

I ordered a chicken sandwich and the presentation was nice and the fruit salad was beautiful. However the chicken was undercooked and disgusting, completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick. The texture!!! I know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it. I hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked. He looked at it and insisted it was fine, that it's how the cook it on the flat top or something like that. He did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all- just snatched my plate up and walked away. I sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes. He completely ignored me for the rest of the meal, as if I had done something wrong. I noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so I guess they figured all was settled. But I take poor service and lack of pride in serving edible meals to be a big deal. I won't be returning to this establishment ever again."

Did I mention it is all you can eat? Tons of different meats to choose from and cooked all different ways. Try as many as you like or as few as you like, however I recommend trying as many as you can. Expensive, however for the amount of food you get (as much as you want), it is much more bang for your buck than some of the other high end restaurants around town. Extremely fun and interesting atmosphere as well, every visit is another great experience!"

        "Review": "I don't usually write reviews but this experience was something worth writing about. I visited Chima last week with some friends and I would say that if you are hungry for some good food and enjoy good customer service then you should visit them soon. The experience was good from the moment you walk into their beautiful establishment. Greeted with warm smiles and hostesses eager to take care of your needs. The mood is nice with the dimmed lights and soft music. The service is good. No waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress. Orders are there in a timely manner, and table is cleared almost instantly. The meat is circulating around like clockwork and is always hot and juicy with flavors that melt in your mouth. Their salad bar features many different options of salads from Mixed Greens to Pasta salads. It also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice. At the table, they bring many different side dishes, which is something I haven't experienced at a Brazilian Steak House before. Even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one. I did however, had an issue with the valet parking I didn't get as stated on their website(update site with start time). My waitress did send a manager my way, he explained the rule(law) that the states has about valet parking(knowledge) and even offered to split the cost for the parking deck payment. I was all smiles after that. I left Chima  happy, stuff and could barely walk but satisfied with the outcome overall. Chima, you will see me again. Thank you for a wonderful evening.By the way, try the Brazilian soda called Guarana Antarctica...SO GOOD"

We met with the event coordinator, Kay Emad, and squared away all details for the day. Kay assured me that every detail we discussed would be met on the day of. When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve."

The newly renovated pro shop is constantly bringing in new gear.

The food is really good. I recommend trying the pretzel twist with cheese on the side (its mouth watering good).\n\nBirthday parties are great too! We've had them at the Ice House for the past several years. There are so many people who have never ice skated and it gives them a great opportunity to have fun while trying something different."

I asked the server for extra crispy wings upon placing my order and the wings were white in some areas looking as if they were baked. Very soft and soggy. A basic franchise like Wing Stop has better wings and also Hickory Tavern with their old bay wings. Hopefully this can be fixed."

My wife was in regular shoes and not participating in any ice skating activities but was still injured. Management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not 'being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities'. I was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an 'activity'. This should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas. Accidents are very likely to happen during crowded times if this is not mandated."

This is one of those restaurants, tucked in to a small unit in a shoping center, that only locals know about.

The atmosphere is fancy enough that you can impress a date but casual enough that you two won't feel out of place if you come in jeans and use a salad fork for your entree.\n\nThere isn't one mean server in the house. They are all friendly (Robbie is the best!) and I'm always impressed with how well they know the menu. I'm not a huge drinker so I'm always ordering virgin drinks. I've never had a non alcoholic drink that didn't taste like a cool spring breeze lol (Rachel is the bartender I like). \n\n You don't wait long for food, it comes out exactly when it should. Speaking of food, I rate it a ten. \n\nTop 3 Apps\n- Aria Caesar Salad (keep the anchovies, I promise they work really well with it. I used to be a no anchovies kinda girl too)\n- Gnocchi (the appetizer, I haven't tried the spinach gnocchi entree yet)\n- SHAVED KALE SALAD!!! PERFECTOOOOO!!\n\nTop 3 Entrees\n- Spaghetti and Meatballs\n- The steak is awesome, if you have a little money to blow.\n- FETTUCCINE CARBONARA! add blackened shrimp and thank Robbie for the bomb suggestion.\n\nBest dessert award goes to the Blackberry Cheesecake! Hands down! \n\nMake sure you get a cappuccino and ask Dennis (the hottest guy ever) for some whipped cream. Thank me later ladies. :)\n\nBottom line, Aria rocks! Great food, great music, and the greatest service ever. Make a reservation if you can because they do fill up fast some nights, even though I never make one and always get a table (but it's purely good luck). Make sure you try the bread, cause Lorrrrdddddd it's the best."

I have now switched to Outback on Independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks. Steaks excellent , service good. John, owner of TRH should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge match. Owner should be a little more humble and not act like the customer in the wrong. He never apologized to me so I took it that he did not care if I came back.

(this is the first time we came to this place) We looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order, when our food came out she didn't bring out the fries we had ordered (which you have to pay 1.99 extra for) we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we weren't getting them. We started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way, the plantains weren't cooked either and the rice was COLD. It was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us, because they were closing, as I was filling up my drink I noticed that they were just re-heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator. NASTY! The food is not fresh and not even cooked all the way and they just re-heat everything. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE!"

Having just returned from vacation in the Outer Banks, I was skeptical of an inland seafood restaurant, but we were pleasantly surprised. The blackened swordfish special was exceptional, even better than the similar special I enjoyed only a week earlier in Nags Head. My wife had the shrimp pasta and loved it as well.\n\nTo top off the excellent food, we had great service, including the struggles that come from eating out with a toddler. \n\nThe only thing I can nit-pick is that the seating was uncomfortable to me, but I wasn't thinking much about that as I enjoyed my meal. \n\nThanks for a great experience for our anniversary!"

While it's still very good, the quality is on par with any other restaurants you'll go to, it used to be exceptional.  I don't know if there was a change in chef  but if they could fix whatever they changed this would be the best place in 100 miles.  \n\nStill highly recommended and lets be honest, Charlotte isn't a hot spot for quality food much less Ft Mill, it's a chain restaurant waste land.\n\nYou must try the calamari fries!"

The shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall. We ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash. The server argued and said the Chef said it had lobster. Fyi my family is from Maine and knew there was no lobster. The crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought. When we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold. The peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream.  This experience embarrassed me for having to bring my family and friends to such a low level high priced dinner.  Never again."

        "Review": "1 of 5 stars Pending review\nMy husband and i ate here on jan 1,2016 and the food was awful. i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens. The grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges. If that wasn't bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate. It was so overbearing I couldn't taste the potatoes or the collards. I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that I wanted and i said no just take it off the bill. Now since this restaurant is listed as an 'upscale' restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was. Well I guess not as no one came so i guess they don't really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket. We also had a 'cup' which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp & lobster bisque and there wasn't a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty. We paid the bill but since they don't seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again. on the way home I was reading their reviews and wished that I had done that before going as there were many bad reviews.\n\nVisited January 2016"

They did away with our favorite salmon dish and changed to some other fish that was inedible. Presentation was beyond basic - the fish was on an essentially empty plate. Service was some of the worst I've ever had - the lady couldn't understand anything. Not to mention, we had planned a birthday surprise, dropping off cake and candles before dinner. The waitress literally came out and asked the entire table 'Should I put the candles in the cake or do you guys want to do it?'. Ruining the entire surprise for the birthday. Won't be back here."

The lunch buffet is good, but a sushi quality is not that high; lots of extra rice, cream cheese, tempura, and lower quality fish. That said, it's fast, filling, and only ~$12. I call it a 'Rock and Rolls' lunch.The real treat is to come here for dinner in the evening. The chef's choice sashimi bowl is amazing. High quality and a higher price, but well worth it."

        "Review": "Much has been written about 'Pike's Old Fashioned Soda Shop' in local print and web publication so we, as a family, decided to give it a try over Father's Day weekend. Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

That's the best advice, I suppose.\n\nAim away from peak hours, for better service, and I personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles, especially for the price - I'm not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up Fried Chicken, but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing, and the waffle was nothing special. To make matters worse, it was served vertically, on a spike, without any clear way to approach it.\n\nI'm rambling. My general view of the menu is that it's focusing too much on being gourmet, and not enough on being... well, GOOD. Another reviewer got it spot-on - the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas.\n\nGreat and (slowly) rotating selection of Belgian and farmhouse style beers, one of the better places for the style in Charlotte if that's what you're into (which is what earns it the third star), but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd that's used to the city's higher-end dining and nightlife. If you've got money to burn on food or mixed drinks, or you're just here for the beer, you could do worse than a night at Heist."

She replied that it wasn't to her liking that it was very dry, bland and not very good at all. The waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes. He removed the dish from the table. He didn't even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal. We will never eat at this restaurant ever again. My advice would be to look elsewhere for Mexican food.

Ima guess that either their food supplier isn't the best or they are trying to cut costs.  I will not be coming back as there are many better sushi places in Charlotte that are the same price or cheaper.   On another note, the atmosphere and the scenery is top notch here."

FIRST,  the seating is horrible  we had a party of 15 and we were all broken up and sent to different tables because CHEDDARS doesn't have enough seating for large parties. I called to make reservations, CHEDDARS doesn't do reservations. Not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different  sections is oblivious. I'M SURE THIS LOCATION LOSES OUT ON A LOT OF MONEY BEHIND THIS VERY REASON. DO BETTER CHEDDARS. I WILL NEVER BRING MY FAMILY TO THIS PLACE AGAIN. \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude26"

The menu does add some variety to Charlotte's Uptown, but it does so without really backing up the offer with flavorful food, a clean restaurant, and consistent service.  P.S. You will smell like you stood by the deep fryer and cooked your own meal after you leave, so word up."

She would walk by and not say a thing - how are you doing/refills...NOTHING (I had to ask her to do things). She only came to my table about two/three times before checking-out. I guess the young girls that work in this restaurant feel they need to cater to a specific population, but this place isn't even high end dining to kiss that much a**. In addition, the food was nasty and cold, not worth my  money, parking, and time. I will NEVER EVER return."

Nice relaxed atmosphere. Good beer selection, with an emphasis on the locals; the cocktails we tried were also very good. The food here is tapas-style, so my wife and I split 5 plates which were all amazing and more than enough. Shout-out to our bartender, Wolf(w\u00fclf?), who made this a 5-star experience.

I thought I had experienced a variety of Asian foods until I ate lunch at the Dragon Court.  This restaurant offers a nice family environment with a majority of Asians supporting the establishment.  Dragon Court is truly ethnic, offering the real deal.  Loved the food and environment.  Although the restaurant is located in an old shopping center with a pot hole ridden parking lot, you tend to forget about this after entering the Dragon Court because they offer  a clean environment. and great service.  I just wish I could find a similar restaurant in Georgia."

After a recent renovation the place looks really good, but the service has fallen off a cliff. Waited 40 minutes for a standard lunch order to get to the table and the place was not even half full. There were at least 5 people working back in the kitchen -- I know because I finally had to go to the kitchen counter to ask to pay my bill so I could leave. Who has 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a salad lunch with a glass of water? The buffalo chicken on my salad consisted of 4 nuggets dipped in sauce. Oh, and to top it off I was charged full price for a kid's meal, which is an advertised special to be free on Tuesdays! I did not have my wits about me to compute that until I had already paid and left. So $44 for 2 adults and one kid to have lunch, including a 10% tip I gave the server purely as a courtesy. Between the food and the service it was barely worth half of that. Too bad to see this place go downhill with no attempt to make things right or compensate the customer."

After writing out what some of us should have on our bill they still messed it up! It took over 30 minutes before they got it 'right'. As compensation another waiter half heartedly gave some of us a voucher for a drink or app (no manager stopped by to apologize). After it was all said and done they still charged me for 2 tickets after reassuring me that the wrong one would be refunded.

As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was 'yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time' .

But the overall experience was unacceptable. First of all, there wasn't a lot of customers. There were maybe 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. The waitress acted as if she didn't want her job. I had to remind her 3 times that I wanted lemon with my water. We ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay. I mean come on! It's water and tea. Any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty. The waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down. She did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was OK. It seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary. Any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers. This lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay. She then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us. We were given a review card before leaving. The experience was OK but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot!

The Wurstplatte was as expected, and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different. \n\nThe Heisse Liebe desert (vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce & 'Peach Schnapps,' topped with homemade whipped cream) was incredibly flavorful, while the Apfelstrudel was understated but better than many."

Trust me, the Optimator tastes much better on draft, along with the rest.  I've never left this place hungry, and I've yet to be disappointed with the food or service after going here for the past 15 years or so.  Be warned, German beer is not Miller lite.  If you're drinking a liter or more, make sure you're not driving.  Pretzel bread, there is none better.  Also, much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in Charlotte, for both food and beer.  Most of what I prefer is between $15 and $20, but there are also some worthwhile options in the low to mid twenties."

It's just the food (quality and portion size) that's not at that level. Came here since I saw good reviews and because it was close to Southpark Mall. However I definitely feel there are way better spots in CLT then this.

The scallops were disturbingly gritty and under cooked, the short ribs were excessively greasy. It was all served over a pumpkin and parmesan polenta that was simply swimming in grease. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. \n\nMy check came out at $53.32. That comprised $26.95 for the entree, $14.95 for one glass of wine, $3.46 in tax... plus an automatic 20% gratuity ($7.96) attached by the server despite the fact that I was in a party of just two. \n\nOverall, it was a very poor experience."

Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of 'ethnic names and poor accents' and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.

She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me 'fries with that'....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.\n\nPlaced our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. \n\nOur order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.\n\nAgain the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing. \n\nSo on the way out the door I mentioned this to the 'manager' and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service. I drop over $20 per person and all the guy could say was he would look into it. \n\nWon't be going back ever. There is a problem there and they don't care to fix it so I won't be back.

We both ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the food came very fast, waitresses were constantly checking in, refilling drinks, and we were satiated and finished by 7:45.

I spoke to the manager Lyle.  He was rude, obnoxious and condescending.  He just kept saying we aren't allowed to take reservations.  I was simply trying to let him know we'd be a large party, so he could possibly seat others accordingly to be able to accommodate a large party (since restaurants have a limited number of tables they can push together.) I was appalled by Lyle's tone, and unwillingness to even listen.  My thought was....do I really want to patron a restaurant where the management is rude and has no customer service skills??  I then called the Mallard Creek location and spoke to their manager Robert.  My entire office goes there for lunch together frequently and Mallard Creek always accommodates us.  Robert was courteous and professional.  He said he would be happy to work with us.  I thanked Robert for his professionalism and told him how rude Lyle was to me. Upon arrival, our table was ready, our server was personable and awesome!  At the end of the night, I was informed that Robert was going to comp my meal to make sure we had a good time and nice experience. Hickory Tavern on E. Arbors Drive is our new location.

He got the number 20 with seafood. About an hour later he spent the entire night throwing up and having diarrhea. I called first thing in the morning to warn them and the manager was EXTREMELY rude. Didn't care and kept saying 'well what can I do about it' I told him he probably should not sell that batch of soup and at least refund that meal. He would not do anything and said there is no way of knowing it was from his food. So disappointed, what awful service."

The service has been great at the metropolitan whichwich every time I go (usually once a week or so). Compared to other sub places, the prices really are not much more, and the quality is so much better than most places!\nMake sure you pick up a rewards card when you go in, once you register it you'll get a free drink, and a free sandwich once you reach 32(maybe 36?) points. \nLOVE WHICHWICH!"

It was very neat and tidy, nicely decorated, and comfortable.  It is a place you can actually enjoy a good meal and hold a conversation you can hear for change.  The food was fantastic (try the stuffed boneless chicken wings... you will be as stuffed and happy as they are, just delicious).  The green curry was equally as good.  The staff and owners are so nice to talk with too.  We will definitely be coming back!"

(Please note, the other two customers at the bar were treated similarly.)

The ramen and sushi are the best you will find in charlotte. Period. \n\nThey will not do take out for the ramen, the ramen will go mushy and cold they say and they are correct. I respect their pride for their work. \n\nIt is a small place that is sometimes packed, it can be slow to be seated, served, and to pay. Sometimes the server can be seen as rude, especially when they are busy. Thats just the way it is here. \n\nI personally think its a privilege to have sushi, ramen and other Japanese dishes of such quality available to me, so everything else is forgivable. \n\n90% of the time i have an awesome experience with the service at this restaurant.  100% of the time the food is great. \n\nIf you can set aside entitlement and just allow time for this place you will be in for a treat."

Most Indian restaurants serve dishes within a narrow range of flavors - a range that those of us who eat in the U.S. have grown accustomed and used to. It's familiar and perhaps a bit boring. Well, get ready for a new adventure if you go here. They have all the traditional dishes - but they come with a twist, a spice, a flavor, a sauce, that you likely haven't seen, smelled, or tasted before. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which was scrumptious. I can't remember what my wife had to eat, because I obsessed and cherished over my own so. But I do remember that she was very impressed. I personally think this place is magisterial in their Indian cooking. If you don't know what that means, I'll just say the cuisine here rocks. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Wish they were located in my hometown.  This one is an exception. You'll be in for a treat if you're in the mood for Indian food. We love this place & will continue to come back!!"

The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's. This place is beautiful but not worth the money, stress, or headache."

We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good. \n\nBruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.\n\nCalamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better fried calamari in other restaurant this one was no that good. \n\nAsparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it. \n\nFor my main course I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it. \n\nMare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cook perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk. \n\nThe service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection. But like I say the Mare saved the day."

After squeezing into the most difficult 'business' spot EVER, I was greeted by a smug face notifying me they were closed, while standing behind a 'hours of operation' sign that clearly stated they were open for 55 additional minutes. \n\nKeep in mind, I visited this establishment's website prior to leaving the house to ensure they would be open so you can understand my frustration. \n\nObviously this business owner doesn't understand that the customer is the MOST important link in the successful business plan. \n\nI found my way to another Subway establishment in Gateway Plaza, that to my utmost surprise was open and able to serve me when their website stated they would be... What a way to do business! \n\nIf you're looking for a late evening sandwich, I would suggest finding your way to this Gateway Subway. If you're looking to damage your vehicle, and NOT have your late evening cravings satisfied, by all means head over to this non-operational franchise... You may want to call first though or make a reservation and by all means don't plan on toasting, that's probably been down since breakfast IF they're open. \n\nThis is NOT the subs you're looking for..."

Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

The food's good, especially for the price.\n\nI've had some inconsistencies, though - a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy, a couple of steaks that have been too well-done for the medium-rare I normally order. I wish there were more appetizing healthy options - the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted, and most of the best savory foods they have on offer are drowning in butter, but I suppose that's what you're going to get with this kind of restaurant. \n\nI always leave feeling full, and it always feels like I more or less got my money's worth - and the staff is really fantastic."

So we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and it's been months. Decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there. Waiter was rude and quick with his responses, he didn't bring everything we ordered form the the start. We had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like I was bothering him by asking. Than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks. When we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last night's leftovers. I know how hard the waiting staff work and I never have tipping less then 20%. But today is the first time I left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left $0.00 tip.

They did ask us how spicy we wanted everything (we chose 3/5). I think we have a better understanding of their spicy-scale and will adjust accordingly for next time. We will definitely be back. Very reasonable prices for good food. Recommended."

I appreciated the expedient service, but the overcooked shrimp in my jumbo shrimp scampi were hard to overlook. Given my previous pleasant dining experiences at the diner, I was disappointed. The chocolate cake made up for the shrimp, though. I will be coming back, I have too much nostalgia tied to this place to let one bad dinner determine any future consumption of whatever else Landmark has to offer. Jeepers, this is comprehensively pretentious given that my only real complaint was some rubbery shrimp."

One gentleman was just brought his food and he immediately asked for his check, which didn't come for 10 min. Then when we went to pay, there was no pen to sign.

It turned out to be one the worst decisions that I made in my life. First of all, I was treated rudely by the front-desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there. Well, I admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places, but I still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several Spanish-speaking dudes who were checking out before me, and who were clearly pointing, looking, and making fun of me... However, I wouldn't give the place 1-star just for that reason alone. On top of that, the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago. I even found a hair in my eggplant, and ended up throwing away about half of the food. I will NEVER come there again. A good thing is that I don't even live anywhere remotely near this place."

After all, it's located in a middle-of- the-woods shopping center that I didn't even know existed!\n\n(Before I review, I must tell you that my little group of pals are VERY chit-chatty, and we can't stop talking.)\n\nThe waitress kindly sat us, all 5 of us, even though the biggest table they had was sat only 4 people. This was probably the only bad thing.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked and the waitress came by every ten minutes to ask about our drink orders, which we finally placed. This was our fault, she was just doing her job.\n\nAnother hour goes by and we finally place our meal order, which included pizzas and different Italian dishes. The food came rather fast and, I can't speak for my friends, but my pizza was cooked perfectly, made-to-order. It was hot and fresh and gooey and oh-so-good.\n\nBy the time we finished our talking, we had realized that the restaurant had actually CLOSED DOWN around us, and we were there at least a half hour after closing. The staff never mentioned it though, which was super-nice and accommodating. I would've expected them to kick us out, which they didn't.\n\nSo overall, great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices too- two pizzas were just $12 + tax and tip."

The place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters, exposed brick walls, eclectic light fixtures, and a peacock over the sushi bar. It is a bit loud, but the DJ spun music is good.\n\nThe food is a great collection of modern interpretations of regional classics in small plates to share. There are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine (but I didn't have enough room to sample). With all of this, there are also simple kebab options, and dip options. Then there's the sushi bar and menu. Yes, eclectic. But tasty and done well.\n\nCoctails are good, wine list is good, and the beer list seemed a bit short, but with more than enough liquors to make up for it. Probably the best bourbon list I've seen since we left Kentucky!"

It doesn't seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest/customer even when it's not busy. It also doesn't have the 'sanitary' feel to it (sanitary grade 96.0). I noticed that not all the staff wear gloves/hair net/hat when handling food. Food it self doesn't look/taste fresh. I had the Noda salad for lunch and it tasted like it's been out all day. Great location - It seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee. However, based on my experience, I wouldn't order anything simply because I wouldn't wanna get sick. It's kinda like waffle house...if that makes any sense."

Great breakfast all day items and I love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items. Love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly. Service and professionalism need improvement. \n\nOn a recent visit, we sat outside (brought the dog; bad idea; July heat) and waited 5-10 minutes before receiving water (repeat... July heat) or menus. Not a great start...but OK. We then proceeded to sit for another 50 minutes before receiving our food.  \n\nThough the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant, the kitchen performance was also spotty...  Parts of the meal were freshly made; other items (ie biscuits and gravy) had heavily congealed; revealing it had sat ready for SOME TIME before it was served. Lines happen and kitchens get backed up; this is not the issue. I will wait for good food; just don't make me wait and then serve bad food.\n \nThe server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server. Perhaps something to be dealt with behind closed doors?"

This place is a bit out of the way and does not look very impressive from the outside, but we were impressed with what they serve.\n\nThe service is very attentive and efficient. The first wow is the selection on the menu. It took a while just to read through them and the selection is overwhelming. Many of the items we've not seen before. The Pho (I had the first item in the Pho section) is very good. The broth is excellent and it didn't leave that MSG aftertaste so I know it was the real good stuff. The pancake is crispy and tasty. The spring roll (get the one that is cold and wrapped in rice cake skin, not the fried one) was pretty good. \n\nThe price was reasonable.\nA very enjoyable meal. I'm not Vietnamese, but I've had my share of Vietnamese food, especially Pho. This was one of the best. I can't vouch for authenticity, but regardless, I enjoyed it."

The meal is served with steamed rice.  The chicken was flattened perhaps too much there was a minimum amount of plain white meat.

But the Charlotte Marriott City Center gets 2 HUGE strikes right now. Never again. I've been here twice and both experiences have been very negative. \n\nOne...the 'mobile key' app they so-hyped since I checked in is glitchy and not ready for prime time. I spent about 5 minutes standing at my door trying to get it to open my door to no avail. I got a message on my phone saying go to the front desk to get a physical key. Their explanation? 'Oh, sometimes it's a little iffy'. You know what? Don't promote it and hype it until it is solidly working. Having worked in IT and dealing with mobile apps...terrible execution. \n\nTwo...I don't like housekeeping in my room, due to past bad experiences. I always put the 'Do not disturb' sign on, and someone from the hotel even saw me put it up this morning and acknowledged it. In my 18 years of reserving rooms myself, I've never had anyone come into my room after putting the sign on, in any type of hotel. But it happened today. Now I don't know who took the sign off, but someone did and all my stuff is now rearranged and I am not happy. So Marriott...it's on you or your clientele."

Along with this, the mall's food court also had a diverse selection. The pizza spot there was very savory.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to shop.

On Friday and Saturday evenings, the mall's main entrance closest to the AMC Theatre becomes an outdoor gang recruitment center complete with cars playing music so loud you can't hear yourself think.\nThis 'scene' has led to two separate shooting incidents in the last two years - though not on weekend nights.  This past Christmas one of those incidents involved a shootout with a Charlotte Police Officer who killed the thug.\n \nThe variety of stores is still good, although there have been several stores that left.

The rest of my friends had plenty of food filling their bowls, which were huge by the way. Who ever designed the menu really likes pineapple because almost every other item had pineapple in it. The sushi just didn't pan out like I was expecting it to. I know when dining in any city like Charlotte, food is going to be marked up. But, when that's the case, at least put some effort into it. The rice was too dry, and the vegetables in it were lacking their natural juices as well leaving the entire roll flavorless. Presentation was okay. It kinda looked like someone was in a rush when plating the sushi. Honestly you'd save more money and time going to Harris Teeter and grabbing some sushi and a bottle of wine. \n\nTL:DR\nSushi is better elsewhere and it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nAnd for God's sake, please get a new DJ.

The only negatives I have are that the chicken was severely under seasoned, and not like the restaurant could do anything about it, but there was a lady on the other side of the restaurant having a conversation so loud that I now know that she has 4 Kids and her unmarried daughter doesn't talk to her anymore.( it annoys me that I know that.)"

The themed neighborhoods are a nice touch and all of the stores are just as epic as the complex here itself.

You might as well get a night at a local hotel so you can come back the next day to explore the other half."

Mussels were bland and barely warm and I think undercooked because they were slimy.  The beef on the sliders was chewy and gray.  Next, dinner.  It was warm, but very bland.  The halibut was dry and there was a tiny bit of slimy crab meat on top.  The lamb was chewy, but the mashed potatoes were good.  Not going back.  Disappointing."

On the side were fingerling potatoes (cooked in duck fat) and asparagus. It was out of this world, and the potatoes were off the chain!\n\nMy wife had Just for the Halibut. The Halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers, spinach, and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc.\n\nShe loved it, although her spinach was a bit sandy. \n\nWe didn't have room for desert, but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake.  Also off the chain! I am typically a fan of dense cheesecake... this is not, but the flavor was amazing."

It was very noisy, TVs were everywhere it seemed and there obviously was no dress code. I did not see any of the usual wait staff, most seemed new and inexperienced for a quality establishment. The entrees: poor quality meat, over seasoned and undercooked. One of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order. The waiter barely graced our presence, never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated. After we ordered the lemon cake , he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill. Just a note on your signature dessert- stale, hard and crusty...at least a few days old. We did speak to the manager about the terrible experience. He quickly became defensive, perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed."

As a waitress you get paid $2.13 hourly.

Our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we're crazy and told US that the table was clean. We had to ask 3 times for them to clean, but it was only grudgingly. Our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum. For some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3' straw thin  French fries it was not worth the time nor the money. \nPutting up with it due to the inclement weather, we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house. This of course, infuriated us more. How a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me."

At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it.

The waitress is very rude and didn't bother to check if we need water and when we wanted to order our dessert, she took our order and came back saying that the kitchen was closed and she didn't bother to let us know that the kitchen was closed before hand and when we asked for an explanation about why we were not informed about the kitchen being closed(BTW we were at PF Chang's from 8:45 PM) and on top of it the waitress started misbehaving and to our shock she started abusing us in a loud voice and asking us to treat her as a person when herself was talking to the customers in a very very rude way that I have never seen someone talk to a customer. This was highly unanticipated and unacceptable from a franchise like PF Chang's.\nI would never recommend any of my friends or family to this place again ever.\nI would give a big zero for the service that was provided to us."

        "Review": "Astonishingly Mediocre\t\n\nAlas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants\u2014unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.\n\nWhile I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn\u2019t busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.\n\nThe two word review:  Why Bother?"

        "Review": "We were in Charlotte over the weekend and ate here on Saturday night.  With it being a Saturday night and a comic book convention weekend we knew it would be busy.  The hostess was very polite.  She told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time.  Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.  I would never leave no tip even with horrible service.  I am very disappointed.  I know $9 is not a lot of money to some but again I did NOT authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill."

This location (as well as the location in CMC/Levine hospital down the street) apparently are needing some training as well as system updates, maybe? I placed an order online for rapid pick-up. It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told 'We're out of that souffl\u00e9. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.' I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffl\u00e9 so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund. This is the SECOND time I've had an issue with this location. I won't return but I suggest you fix it soon, Panera"

The waitress seemed like she had never waited tables before. We were brought water after a table that sat down after us did. The waitress told us the specials, but when we went to order, found out that 1/3 of the menu was not available because they were out. She did not offer substitutions or other options, which we heard her give other guests. The food was barely average, and the grits notably came out barely warm. The ham was over salted, and my fiance's omelet special with 'ham' had no ham in it. We will be moving to this area soon, and will likely not return to The Liberty."

        "Review": "This review relates only to the Annual Oyster Feast.  We attended the 3rd annual one on October 2nd, 2014.\n\nPrice per head was $95.  Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.\n\nThe oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.\n\nOther selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)\n\nAfter about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.\n\nOverall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."

I just love that Ruby Tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce!  :)   They seated all 8 of us pretty quickly, service was good, and the food was consistent.\nPositives: Pretty good salad bar (they have spinach!), healthy side choices, consistently good food.\nNegatives: They were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky."

The whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance.

The food was fast, service was great, and the people were friendly! On top of that the food was delicious! We'll definitely be back soon!"

Not sure if it had been sitting out too long but it smelled and the small bite I tasted was not fit for consumption. I did enjoy the biscuit and gravy along with made to order eggs Benedict. I'm a foodie so I don't mind paying for great food and experiences but when it was all said and done it felt over priced."

Almost five years ago we had our rehearsal dinner here, and Chef Majid and his staff made sure everything was just perfect. Our friends and family still rave about how good the food was. Since then, we've also celebrated my father-in-law's 70th birthday, complete with a gorgeous dessert tray seemingly prepared for a celebrity. We are grateful for the memories and the personal hospitality we receive at every meal. Family brunch, lunch date, drinks & apps, and of course dinner--all are fabulous reasons to dine at Bistro La Bon!"

She showed us to our table where we were acknowledged by JC. He went over the beer sheets and the fact that Rock Bottom is a Brewery with brew-master Robb,  and all of their food is made from scratch by their head chef Korey. The Asiago crab dip was a great recommendation as well as the carrot cake for desert. Great suggestive selling. Our entrees were out in less than twenty minutes. We even had a couple of managers stop in periodically to check on us. I think their names were Nick and Kevin. Great guys. I am a mystery shopper by trade and always take notes on my visits.  I definitely rate this location to be in the top 10 restaurants in Charlotte! Also did you know they are Charlotte's oldest brewery! Truly an amazing experience."

Specials most days of the week, and routinely there are special tappings or events with rare beers. If you like beer, and are in the University area, this should be your place to go.\n\nCome find me there. I'm the loud, bald, fat man there on Monday nights. Let's have a beer."

I want to walk away from that feeling like 'That was incredible and I can't wait to go again'. That is not even close to what we felt. We got the 'newbie' waiter, so the service was not top notch. We were told the special came with a white wine sauce, only to overhear another waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce. Sure enough, it came out with a red sauce. If the price of the meal was in the $60 range I might not be so critical. But when you pay what I consider to be a pretty pricey cost...add to that the fact that the $9 glass of wine came from an $8 bottle (it was good wine, but I don't need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction), I would say it was just 'ok'. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth going back to when there are so many other great places in the area."

I'm sure they do make mistakes once in awhile and that's to be expected since we're only human and keep in mind when you're reading these reviews that only a handful of ppl leave them and 90% of ppl leaving reviews are ppl that are just snobby or truly had an unfortunate experience. I'm the manager at Tint W*[%* and know how reviews can affect a business and how there's some ppl out there you just can't please so all I'm saying is give the place a try, I'm sure you'll love it...and make sure you try the bang bang shrimp."

Jordan brings us our drinks and a loaf of bread with pesto. Jordan also bring me a salad with some kind of NUT/Seed concoction. I saw the nuts on my salad and told him to take it away. He said they are not NUTs they are pumpkin nuts. While eating my salad my mouth started burning. I was having an allergic reaction. I didn't know why. I asked my husband to google pesto. Pesto has PINE NUTS in them. We told Jordan and he said that pesto at Bonefish Grill does not have NUT. I then asked for hot tea. My allergic reaction made me nauseated so I rushed home. When I googles Bonefish Pesto this morning this I what I found \n\n1 cup basil leaves\n1/4 cup Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup PINE NUTS\n2 garlic cloves, chopped\n1/4 tsp salt\n6 Kalamata olives\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nI think servers should be knowledgeable about the items they are serving.

The Hostess was dumbstruck when I asked how much longer. She said there were no guests waiting/unseated. She asked me 3 times for my name and number in my party. She finally told me to go into the bar and she would find a server. I'll quickly bullet the rest on the evening:\n- not given water after asking\n- received drinks 20 minutes after ordering\n- 1 refill required extreme effort and 1 hour\n- food was cafeteria quality\n- server was superficially smiling but obviously perturbed\n- drunk panhandler was greeted by the barmaid by name. Larry then proceeded to ask table after table of diners for gas money. 4th table complained to the barmaid who finally asked Larry to leave.\n- salad refill never arrived.\n\nPreviously 3 stars:\nAsk for Server Lynette.

The drinks themselves could be served better.  \n\nNow I'm not one to be a drink sob, when you wanna get a good buzz on, then serve is however you can.  But when you ask for a Jager Bomb or an Irish Car Bomb, then I think their  respective shots should drop/bomb into the drink.  In theory, that would happen if the shot was in..say...a shot glass.  They served the shot is a plastic medicine cup.  That makes it difficult to drink/bomb/enjoy.  The shot was just floating in the pint glass.\n\nDoes anyone remember Exxon Valdez?  Plastic is made of oil, and oil floats.\n\nAlso, one more thing.   The music is so damn loud, that I can't hear myself think about how loud the music is.  \n\nI understand...It tries to be classy, what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels, like a posh NYC night club...but this is a bowling alley.\n\nAn Alley."

Then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time, after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost. After not checking if the keys were turned in, and initially saying 'no', he began to respond with things like, 'it's not my f***ing responsibility if you lost your keys',  'I don't have your keys you f***ing stupid b**ch,' and 'stop giving me attitude about your keys' (when she clearly wasn't). I was standing right next to her, and after repeated comments like this, I'd heard enough and said, 'hey man, the girl lost her keys, and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here, what is your problem?' He immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me 'What the f***k are you going to do about it?' (something I don't think was necessary, at all, at this point). He proceeds to call over security who says, 'Hey let's talk about this over here' (pointing to a spot away from the bar). I agreed saying, 'yes, let's talk about it' (after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt, by an overly aggressive bar tender). Security proceeds to push me out a side door without saying a word. If this is the kind of bar you would like to go to, then I highly recommend it."

Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."

Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

        "Review": "Stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament.  My biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside (which I told them about several times) and the laundry/cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived (after 6pm).  In general, they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff.  But our room was clean, so that is good.  This is your typical Hyatt Place, so if you are familiar with the brand and layout, you know what to expect.  The lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast, but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful.  This hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators (which are in the hallways right behind the front desk, also used for access to/from the lobby and other rooms).   This was definitely a problem during high traffic times, you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators.  Very poor layout in my opinion.  Otherwise, the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a Hyatt Place, so if you like the layout it will be the same.   I really like the sitting area, it's quite large and has a big L-shaped sofa and a separate desk.  Really nice!   The only thing I don't like about these rooms is the 'open' bathroom area.  The sink is basically in the bedroom so it's very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready (like brushing your teeth) without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping.   But if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time, no problem.\nNegatives: Small lobby and breakfast area (cramped if busy), overflowing trash cans outside, a lot of laundry/cleaning carts in hallways, very cramped elevator location.\nPositives: Large rooms, new, modern, room was clean and quiet."

I think that this place has potential,but I think that this hotel needs some extra staff because the manger is working the bar the check in and check out and the mini market.  The pullout sofa was not cleaned the sheet was pulled back and there was a sweaty towel in there to. There was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored,but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms. That did not make a difference. The pool is fun and besides these mishaps this hotel has some work to do."

        "Review": "First, I would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job. Lucy, is an angel. It meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea. I know grandma CAN do it herself, but we encourage her to let us help her.  For anyone that looks after someone who has needs, the little things mean the world to people who take care of them. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. \n\nHowever, Hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people. It is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people (especially at night), as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped.  Bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location.\n\nThere was some confusion or miscommunication about the room I had booked. I booked a two bed room, and what I received was a one bed room with a pull out couch. The other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed. Truth be told, I was not stoked to sleep on the floor on Friday for $140 a night. However, we were able to move rooms on Saturday. \n\nHyatt! Spend the money and supply your staff team!\n\nHotel policy's are a 'hit and miss'.  What I mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay, but be charged for it another time. \n\nThere is apparently a $30 'damage fee' to cover any hotel property if ruined.  I was not charged this fee before, so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill. However, the kind desk manager, Joel, was able to remove it. \n\nThis is my second time at this hotel, and both times I had my dog. The first time I was not charged $75 (even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file). For the record, the dog is well behaved.  When I asked the manager (name?) about it, he simply told me that it was policy. I told the manager I understood, but if there if a policy, follow through with it at all times. He removed it, but honestly, the money didn't matter. It is more important that I can be informed.  I was frustrated. I felt like I was being  'dismissed' from the conversation by having the charge dropped. I want to be informed so I am prepared for the charge on my bill. \n\nBottom line, if you have a policy, follow through with it at all times. Inconsistency kills a business. I do not like to be surprised with 'fees' I was not informed of, nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel. \n\nI don't get to see my family as often as I like since I took a job in Florida, so these trips are special to us. I chose Hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends. I chose this particular location due to other customer reviews. My first visit compared to my last visit was night and day. \n\nWhen I left, I felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel. I am a client who like to 'have it together' as far as reservations and what to expect. I set this trip up for my family, and I feel like I failed them. \n\nIt was good to see old friends and family during my visit, but the hotel was not a nice stay."

        "Review": "To be quite honest service is poor.. \nI've attented this resturant few times. \nAt first they treated me as a costumer should be treated. It wasn't until later that i was treated very poorly. maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior i've incounter is unacceptable. I would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out. I was patient until I realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress. As a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking. (but of course thats just me) \nSecond, when my family & i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the 'kitchen was close' and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half  before closing time but even then that didn't much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it wasn't until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me .. they refuse to serve my family & i but served them no questions asked? I THINK NOT .. an apologe was not even giving to us. \nThirdly, the  DJ is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song. I as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee. As an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj .. \nThis resturant is a disappointment big time.  I would be damned if i step foot here again. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime!."

Then the salty bacon, the sweet jd's BBQ sauce paired with a medium flavor cheese and a salty crispy onion ring gave me something I was not expecting...pure mouth joy. The semi floppy  (requested) chips had this seasoning (salty, peppery sweet) that were amazing, too.

The hostess, Juliana, was very pleasant and helpful as I was traveling from Columbia for dinner. After being seated at 7:15 on Monday evening, it wasn't until 7:45 before we had our drinks. We reluctantly had to ask the hostess to put in our appetizer orders. We had the Yellowfin tuna tartare and the charcuterie board which were well balanced and flavorful. Yet, it was still a constant struggle for service. \n\nOur server got our entree orders wrong and failed to bring out our 2nd round of drinks after multiple times of us requesting them. He also didn't come see us after we received our meal so I didn't get to eat what I ordered. I had the 10oz filet with bordelaise, which had fantastic flavor and texture - the bordelaise was a perfect accompaniment. To no surprise, paying the bill was just a difficult. \n\nTo my knowledge, the restaurant was launching a new menu tonight, which, understandably, could be problematic for some servers. The problem was that we routinely saw our waiter pass us to help out the other tables around us, yet he repeatedly neglected to attend to our table. I expect more in terms of service when I pay $120 for a dinner for two. It pained me to even leave a decent tip. The food, on the contrary, was phenomenal - which is why I gave the rating 2 stars. The interior had a very upbeat and lively atmosphere."

The Wagyu steak was good, but I could do better for cheaper.  Another dish we were served was barely-cooked vegetables.  Everyone was appropriately apologetic, but due to the slow service and limited vegetable options, we had to just leave it.  My recommendation to the place?  Less expensive fancy cuts of meat and more attention to the easy details -- like cooking vegetables!\n\nIf you want to try something new in Charlotte, you might want to move this one down the list til they can sort their kitchen issues."

Good amount of crab and a great hush puppy batter with a house made tartar blend. I had the mammoth burger with everything and the house made pimento cheese. Burger was cooked excellent however I wish they had given a little more pimento. I couldn't taste the cheese on the burger. I had two absolute peppar bloody Mary's and they were the best I've had in a long time. We will definitely be returning frequently!"

The biscuits and gravy definitely live up to their hype, the shrimp and grits were etouffee style and sort of tomato based yet very good! The steak, pecan chicken and salmon were scrumptious. The Mac and cheese was okay (better to look at than eat) and I ended up too full for desert, but did sneek a chocolate covered berry, lol. Very Clean bathrooms, and nice ambiance. the food is Worth the $$. Get Eric and pay him WELL he is a great server.:)"

The bar was fine if you get a seat away from the front door. They have a neat fish tank and the bartender was attentive to drinks and food which was nice. If you like hot tea I would highly recommend getting a pot of their hot tea. It is delicious and some of the best tea I have had. I'm not a big burger fan so I've only stuck with the sushi here. They have some nice combinations and some good options if you want to stay away from anything fried (although fried anything is so good).  My favorite so far is the tropical storm roll because it comes with a decent amount of fish and a nice sauce. If you want an appetizer, the tuna-Tini is really good and is a pretty good portion.  Good food, good atmosphere."

Was a bit messy/soggy and it pretty well fell apart towards the end, but still good and worth it.\n\nThey have a really good selection of hot sauces, ranked 1-10, so grabbed a couple of small cups of them for garnish on the sandwich.\n\nWait time to get the sandwich was a little long, especially when you measure against JJ or Subway, but the wait was worth it."

Knew it would be busy but we were in no hurry and the weather was great. All was going fine until we received our food. I ordered a chicken sandwich and the presentation was nice and the fruit salad was beautiful. However the chicken was undercooked and disgusting, completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick. The texture!!! I know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it. I hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked. He looked at it and insisted it was fine, that it's how the cook it on the flat top or something like that. He did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all- just snatched my plate up and walked away. I sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes. He completely ignored me for the rest of the meal, as if I had done something wrong. I noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so I guess they figured all was settled. But I take poor service and lack of pride in serving edible meals to be a big deal. I won't be returning to this establishment ever again."

Nobody came to take our drink order; nobody even looked at us. There were empty tables everywhere and the wait staff didn't seem to be busy as the lunch rush was just wrapping up. The menus on the table and the absence of beverages should have been an indicator that we hadn't been helped. We got up to leave and nobody seemed to care. We left and nobody said goodbye.

I visited Chima last week with some friends and I would say that if you are hungry for some good food and enjoy good customer service then you should visit them soon. The experience was good from the moment you walk into their beautiful establishment. Greeted with warm smiles and hostesses eager to take care of your needs. The mood is nice with the dimmed lights and soft music. The service is good. No waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress. Orders are there in a timely manner, and table is cleared almost instantly. The meat is circulating around like clockwork and is always hot and juicy with flavors that melt in your mouth. Their salad bar features many different options of salads from Mixed Greens to Pasta salads. It also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice. At the table, they bring many different side dishes, which is something I haven't experienced at a Brazilian Steak House before. Even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one. I did however, had an issue with the valet parking I didn't get as stated on their website(update site with start time). My waitress did send a manager my way, he explained the rule(law) that the states has about valet parking(knowledge) and even offered to split the cost for the parking deck payment. I was all smiles after that. I left Chima  happy, stuff and could barely walk but satisfied with the outcome overall. Chima, you will see me again. Thank you for a wonderful evening.By the way, try the Brazilian soda called Guarana Antarctica...SO GOOD"

Did I mention it is all you can eat? Tons of different meats to choose from and cooked all different ways. Try as many as you like or as few as you like, however I recommend trying as many as you can. Expensive, however for the amount of food you get (as much as you want), it is much more bang for your buck than some of the other high end restaurants around town. Extremely fun and interesting atmosphere as well, every visit is another great experience!"

We met with the event coordinator, Kay Emad, and squared away all details for the day. Kay assured me that every detail we discussed would be met on the day of. When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve."

Management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not 'being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities'. I was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an 'activity'. This should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas.

I've never had a non alcoholic drink that didn't taste like a cool spring breeze lol (Rachel is the bartender I like). \n\n You don't wait long for food, it comes out exactly when it should. Speaking of food, I rate it a ten. \n\nTop 3 Apps\n- Aria Caesar Salad (keep the anchovies, I promise they work really well with it. I used to be a no anchovies kinda girl too)\n- Gnocchi (the appetizer, I haven't tried the spinach gnocchi entree yet)\n- SHAVED KALE SALAD!!! PERFECTOOOOO!!\n\nTop 3 Entrees\n- Spaghetti and Meatballs\n- The steak is awesome, if you have a little money to blow.\n- FETTUCCINE CARBONARA! add blackened shrimp and thank Robbie for the bomb suggestion.\n\nBest dessert award goes to the Blackberry Cheesecake! Hands down! \n\nMake sure you get a cappuccino and ask Dennis (the hottest guy ever) for some whipped cream. Thank me later ladies. :)\n\nBottom line, Aria rocks! Great food, great music, and the greatest service ever. Make a reservation if you can because they do fill up fast some nights, even though I never make one and always get a table (but it's purely good luck). Make sure you try the bread, cause Lorrrrdddddd it's the best."

I was raised, by a father who loves sushi, to make my own sushi at home.\n\nThis is the best Sushi I have ever had, made by one of the nicer cooks I've ever met - Jackie, who runs the place, and is seemingly always there, happily smiling as he works under a wall that is almost certainly going to collapse under the weight of the awards the place has won. This is one of those restaurants, tucked in to a small unit in a shoping center, that only locals know about. I only found out about it because a now-ex used to work there, and now I tell everyone I can.\n\nThere's apparently other items on the menu than sushi, or so I've been told. If that matters to you."

As you walk in you are expecting a server to come and sit you down because of the linen tables, no one come we stood there for about 10 mins, the cashiers were behind the counter and didn't acknowledge us. (this is the first time we came to this place) We looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order, when our food came out she didn't bring out the fries we had ordered (which you have to pay 1.99 extra for) we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we weren't getting them. We started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way, the plantains weren't cooked either and the rice was COLD. It was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us, because they were closing, as I was filling up my drink I noticed that they were just re-heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator.

Next time it sent back the owner John brought it out and this time it was done right. But it turned into a 3 couse meal. I eat my salad. then I had my vegetables, low and behold had a steak last. The week before that I was in around 6pm and ordered Salmon and the middle was raw, raw. I was eating at the Lucky Texan about 3 times every two weeks. I have now switched to Outback on Independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks. Steaks excellent , service good. John, owner of TRH should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge match. Owner should be a little more humble and not act like the customer in the wrong. He never apologized to me so I took it that he did not care if I came back. Did not penalize the server, always tip because I know it is not the server. Thanks John, I am getting my steak cooked properly."

The server argued and said the Chef said it had lobster. Fyi my family is from Maine and knew there was no lobster. The crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought. When we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold. The peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream.

The grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges. If that wasn't bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate. It was so overbearing I couldn't taste the potatoes or the collards. I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that I wanted and i said no just take it off the bill. Now since this restaurant is listed as an 'upscale' restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was. Well I guess not as no one came so i guess they don't really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket. We also had a 'cup' which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp & lobster bisque and there wasn't a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty. We paid the bill but since they don't seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again. on the way home I was reading their reviews and wished that I had done that before going as there were many bad reviews.\n\nVisited January 2016"

Service was some of the worst I've ever had - the lady couldn't understand anything. Not to mention, we had planned a birthday surprise, dropping off cake and candles before dinner.

Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

I spent many nights drinking shots and delicious concoctions in this place. It always reminded me of New York Pubs (especially in the winter). The food was always top notch and the best pub food money could buy. When I think of Charlotte epic restaurants, I think of Al Mike's, Gus' Sir Beef, South 21, The Penguin, The Diamond, The Knife and Fork, The Coffee Cup, The Liberty, Holly Farms, The Barclay, The Cajun Queen, Catherine's, Fenwick's, The Laurel Market, Hotel Charlotte, Red Rocks, Open Kitchen, and the list goes on....."

My wife took two bits of her chimichanga and immediately decided not to finish it. The waiter came back by some time later and asked my wife if everything was okay. She replied that it wasn't to her liking that it was very dry, bland and not very good at all. The waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes. He removed the dish from the table. He didn't even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal. We will never eat at this restaurant ever again. My advice would be to look elsewhere for Mexican food. There's much friendly and delicious Mexican restaurants out there."

When did she think it would be cloudy? Lol. Anyways I told her no thank you, I will come back when it's cloudy. I was not impressed.

That's the best advice, I suppose.\n\nAim away from peak hours, for better service, and I personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles, especially for the price - I'm not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up Fried Chicken, but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing, and the waffle was nothing special. To make matters worse, it was served vertically, on a spike, without any clear way to approach it.\n\nI'm rambling. My general view of the menu is that it's focusing too much on being gourmet, and not enough on being... well, GOOD. Another reviewer got it spot-on - the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas.\n\nGreat and (slowly) rotating selection of Belgian and farmhouse style beers, one of the better places for the style in Charlotte if that's what you're into (which is what earns it the third star), but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd that's used to the city's higher-end dining and nightlife. If you've got money to burn on food or mixed drinks, or you're just here for the beer, you could do worse than a night at Heist."

The food here is tapas-style, so my wife and I split 5 plates which were all amazing and more than enough. Shout-out to our bartender, Wolf(w\u00fclf?), who made this a 5-star experience.

We then ordered the delmonico and found out they were out of that; my wife then ordered the prime rib and to her dismay that was not available either! So she settled for the salmon and I got the filet. C'mon Firebirds, you are a 'steak house' and on a Monday night NO STEAK!!! Well not a selection."

I probably wouldn't come back to this specific location, they seemed overwhelmed."

However, the new Ziosks, which are the at-table ordering and payment devices are very confusing. The waiters and waitresses will generally let customers pay another way, without having to use the Ziosk.\n\nThe food is always great.

My boyfriend's corn was extremely salty as well.\n\nIn addition, the a la carte style means that you're going to be spending a good chunk of your paycheck there.

After a recent renovation the place looks really good, but the service has fallen off a cliff. Waited 40 minutes for a standard lunch order to get to the table and the place was not even half full. There were at least 5 people working back in the kitchen -- I know because I finally had to go to the kitchen counter to ask to pay my bill so I could leave. Who has 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a salad lunch with a glass of water? The buffalo chicken on my salad consisted of 4 nuggets dipped in sauce. Oh, and to top it off I was charged full price for a kid's meal, which is an advertised special to be free on Tuesdays! I did not have my wits about me to compute that until I had already paid and left. So $44 for 2 adults and one kid to have lunch, including a 10% tip I gave the server purely as a courtesy. Between the food and the service it was barely worth half of that. Too bad to see this place go downhill with no attempt to make things right or compensate the customer."

But the overall experience was unacceptable. First of all, there wasn't a lot of customers. There were maybe 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. The waitress acted as if she didn't want her job. I had to remind her 3 times that I wanted lemon with my water. We ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay. I mean come on! It's water and tea. Any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty. The waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down. She did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was OK. It seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary. Any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers. This lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay. She then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us. We were given a review card before leaving. The experience was OK but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot! My boyfriend and I believe in tipping excellent customer service. Well this lady didn't deserve a cent of the tip I left."

Trust me, the Optimator tastes much better on draft, along with the rest.  I've never left this place hungry, and I've yet to be disappointed with the food or service after going here for the past 15 years or so.  Be warned, German beer is not Miller lite.  If you're drinking a liter or more, make sure you're not driving.  Pretzel bread, there is none better.  Also, much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in Charlotte, for both food and beer.  Most of what I prefer is between $15 and $20, but there are also some worthwhile options in the low to mid twenties."

Their regular prices are not out of line with their food quality and portions. Average dinner entr\u00e9e seems to be $17.\n\nMy salmon was perfectly done; most evenly cooked I'd ever had at a restaurant. The almond rice was fantastic in the reisling sauce from the salmon. The Wurstplatte was as expected, and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different. \n\nThe Heisse Liebe desert (vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce & 'Peach Schnapps,' topped with homemade whipped cream) was incredibly flavorful, while the Apfelstrudel was understated but better than many."

The only positive comment I can make is that they are consistent; consistently horrible. The product I have been handed has probably matched my actual order 10% of the time - that is, the odds of the employees doing their jobs correctly is 1 in 10. Knowing this, do not be surprised if you are handed McDonalds. I will never return to this location and I suggest others avoid it as well."

Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of 'ethnic names and poor accents' and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.

I of course had to have the steak, it was really good - when I asked them to do it medium, it actually WAS medium - not medium rare, etc.  Really well done.\n\nMy one complaint is that the floor space seemed slightly cramped but really not overly so, it gets a bit noisy for a place of this caliber, but short of that, it was an excellent experience.  We will definitely be back again, there is really little they can do to make it better than it is."

Walking in you get the impression it's going to be a good time and then it all went south.\n\nWe sat at our table for at least 10 - 15 minutes with no one checking on us then the server showed up smelling like she had just smoked a carton with Joe Camel. She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me 'fries with that'....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.\n\nPlaced our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. \n\nOur order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.\n\nAgain the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing. \n\nSo on the way out the door I mentioned this to the 'manager' and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service. I drop over $20 per person and all the guy could say was he would look into it. \n\nWon't be going back ever. There is a problem there and they don't care to fix it so I won't be back. I was warned before I went and didn't listen."

Besides other food, 3 in our group ordered gumbo,  2 sausage gumbos and 1 seafood gumbo.\nThe food came out shortly after placing our orders.  \nIt was only after we started eating when we realized that there as a mix-up on the gumbos.  The person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa.  As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was 'yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time' .  WHAT?  Unbelievable and irresponsible are kindest words the words that come to mind.  \nSorry, Razzoo's Cajun Cafe, this could have been a much better review since the food itself was actually fairly good, but this kind of mistake is inexcusable."

The only thing that takes away from this place for me seems to be the uncajun portions. You don't get a whole lot for what you pay for here like you would if you were down in Louisiana. But if you are looking to try to at least mimic that Cajun taste and feel, this is a good place to try."

I spoke to the manager Lyle.  He was rude, obnoxious and condescending.  He just kept saying we aren't allowed to take reservations.  I was simply trying to let him know we'd be a large party, so he could possibly seat others accordingly to be able to accommodate a large party (since restaurants have a limited number of tables they can push together.) I was appalled by Lyle's tone, and unwillingness to even listen.  My thought was....do I really want to patron a restaurant where the management is rude and has no customer service skills??  I then called the Mallard Creek location and spoke to their manager Robert.  My entire office goes there for lunch together frequently and Mallard Creek always accommodates us.  Robert was courteous and professional.  He said he would be happy to work with us.  I thanked Robert for his professionalism and told him how rude Lyle was to me. Upon arrival, our table was ready, our server was personable and awesome!  At the end of the night, I was informed that Robert was going to comp my meal to make sure we had a good time and nice experience. Hickory Tavern on E. Arbors Drive is our new location.  We will no longer patron Harris Corners because of Lyle's poor attitude."

I got lucky, I needed a table for two, and the hostess offered to seat us despite a full reservation list, and she she kindly asked if we would mind if we needed to be finished by 8:30 (we were seated around 7).  I personally appreciated that, instead of being turned away.   We both ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the food came very fast, waitresses were constantly checking in, refilling drinks, and we were satiated and finished by 7:45.  I'd prefer a lunch sandwich here more than paying the same for a jersey mikes sub, which are pretty good, but not as good as what they serve here."

The place can be pretty busy after hours on the weekends and I have seen many people get into fights so beware if you want to come at this time. Their biscuits and gravy are also really good. I am not a fan of their hashbrowns as they tend to be soggy and full of oil. An okay place when everything else is closed. They have a dessert case that I have never tried, but I did have a strawberry milkshake from here that was really good and pretty cheap for how huge it was!"

The steaks were cooked properly, and the sides were good. Dessert was alright, but to be honest we were full at that point. The experience wasn't terrible, but not great.

Lately I don't know if they have new management or staff but the service really went down the drain. Went down there for my daughter's birthday to celebrate and seemed like that they were doing us a favor by been in there. So we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and it's been months. Decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there. Waiter was rude and quick with his responses, he didn't bring everything we ordered form the the start. We had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like I was bothering him by asking. Than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks. When we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last night's leftovers. I know how hard the waiting staff work and I never have tipping less then 20%. But today is the first time I left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left $0.00 tip. If you want to eat here throw your money in the trash can out side and eat some grass on the side of the road and you'll have better experience."

Most Indian restaurants serve dishes within a narrow range of flavors - a range that those of us who eat in the U.S. have grown accustomed and used to. It's familiar and perhaps a bit boring. Well, get ready for a new adventure if you go here. They have all the traditional dishes - but they come with a twist, a spice, a flavor, a sauce, that you likely haven't seen, smelled, or tasted before. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which was scrumptious. I can't remember what my wife had to eat, because I obsessed and cherished over my own so. But I do remember that she was very impressed. I personally think this place is magisterial in their Indian cooking. If you don't know what that means, I'll just say the cuisine here rocks. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Wish they were located in my hometown.  This one is an exception. You'll be in for a treat if you're in the mood for Indian food. We love this place & will continue to come back!!"

The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's.

Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good. \n\nBruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.\n\nCalamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better fried calamari in other restaurant this one was no that good. \n\nAsparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it. \n\nFor my main course I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it. \n\nMare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cook perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk. \n\nThe service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection. But like I say the Mare saved the day."

Most of them are married, so I guess they cannot be bothered to be nice to patrons.  This Hooters is old and out of date. Many other Hooters have been renovated. The overall atmosphere is that they are doing you a favor by serving you. \n\nI understand that Hooters will hire anyone now to be an equal opportunity employer, but some pleasant staff would be nice."

The most recent time I went I did get a trainee that stumbled a few times but she still was able to keep the mood light and relaxed while she fixed whatever went wrong on her register computer. \n\nThe decorations are nice. It looks great and is always clean. I noticed my table being cleaned as soon as I walked out the door. The employees are on top of that. The only thing it's lacking is booth seating. It's only got two booth tables in the entire place iirc. But that's a very minor thing that the rest of the experience more than makes up for"

Great during Olympics.\n- Music was enjoyably random.\n- Good beer selection.\n- Waitress was attentive.\n- Tasty fries.\n\nThe bad:\n- I ordered the chicken tacos, and stating there was chicken in them is generous.  Maybe three nuggets of assorted chicken bits, but well outweighed by the other stuff.  Picture attached to my review.\n- I didn't get a beer menu until after I got my food.  Would have ordered my first beer differently had I got a menu.\n- 5 Stars of Heat for spicy garlic sauce?  Maybe that is the case, but there was so little chicken in the tacos I couldn't tell."

And then moments later your server comes and ask if everything is ok, he doesn't have the syrup so you have to ask again.And wait again.c While waiting for a doggie bag we asked the hostess for a doggie bag, He said I'll get your server.

Great burgers in this family (if not shtick-y) themed restaurant. \nThey have a ordering line, then you sit until your name is called. From there, you can help yourself to the salad (and burger toppings) bar, get some extra  spud spice for your wedges, and top your gluttonous meal with a bit of [heated] Cheese sauce. After dinner you can treat the kids to a hand-spun milkshake or baked in house cookie, both which are delicious. Kids can also enjoy an arcade game or watch one of 5~7 TV's."

Constantly running food to the wrong table and was very awkward. I do feel bad because it seems like he was just given the job without any training whatsoever. The trivia questions on trivia night were laughable. If you want to go somewhere that hosts Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader nights then this is your place. It would not have been so awful if our server was even around. We had 1 beer the whole night because our server was not present to even ask if we wanted another beer or refill on water. Food was mediocre at best. Good customer service can always make up for lackluster food but this was definitely not the case. Bad attitude among entire staff including management and all around disorganized. It's a shame because it's a great location."

Very thin crispy crust and healthy but would like ingredients to stretch the entirety of the pizza. Drunken goat pizza is awesome. Corn beef, carmelized onions, pepper jack and goat cheese topped with beer glaze...unbelievable! That pizza is worth five stars! One complaint -$6 pints! No reason to ever be over $5, and personally i would like to see $4 pints! Let's face it, birdsong brewery is the only one around doing $4 pints and i wish all other breweries and restaurants would do the same!"

The food's good, especially for the price.\n\nI've had some inconsistencies, though - a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy, a couple of steaks that have been too well-done for the medium-rare I normally order. I wish there were more appetizing healthy options - the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted, and most of the best savory foods they have on offer are drowning in butter, but I suppose that's what you're going to get with this kind of restaurant. \n\nI always leave feeling full, and it always feels like I more or less got my money's worth - and the staff is really fantastic."

Then tell her she might be right but he would know normally since he doesn't try the food.  Then he paraded around to the other staff in an obvious attempt to make a mockery of the situation.

The chocolate cake made up for the shrimp, though.

Got a bottle of red and it was downright warm (felt like it was kept in a hot area of the kitchen). We had to ask for a bucket of ice to get it cool enough to drink. \n\nRich sauce, doughy bread, and everyone gets about a pound of spaghetti--enjoy the leftovers!"

Called the store to cancel the order due to leaving work, I was hung up on twice and the third time calling I finally got through. The manager said she would put a credit under my number for a free pizza next time. Today I ordered again and the pizza took an hour to get here and was cold at arrival. I do not recommended ordering from here. The staff are not friendly. I would recommend hiring all new staff and teach them how to properly run a business."

After all, it's located in a middle-of- the-woods shopping center that I didn't even know existed!\n\n(Before I review, I must tell you that my little group of pals are VERY chit-chatty, and we can't stop talking.)\n\nThe waitress kindly sat us, all 5 of us, even though the biggest table they had was sat only 4 people. This was probably the only bad thing.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked and the waitress came by every ten minutes to ask about our drink orders, which we finally placed. This was our fault, she was just doing her job.\n\nAnother hour goes by and we finally place our meal order, which included pizzas and different Italian dishes. The food came rather fast and, I can't speak for my friends, but my pizza was cooked perfectly, made-to-order. It was hot and fresh and gooey and oh-so-good.\n\nBy the time we finished our talking, we had realized that the restaurant had actually CLOSED DOWN around us, and we were there at least a half hour after closing. The staff never mentioned it though, which was super-nice and accommodating. I would've expected them to kick us out, which they didn't.\n\nSo overall, great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices too- two pizzas were just $12 + tax and tip."

The lady who is THE ONLY server in the restaurant it seems is constantly walking away before we are even finished with our order !  We have to ask for everything and she is ALWAYS in a rush and seems overwhelmed every time we go.... We usually sit in the bar part and she always served us but switched to the restaurant part and yup, it was HER AGAIN...... FOOD IS GREAT but server is absolutely horrendous .... We have referred a ton of people to this restaurant but that will stop after our 2nd and 3rd previous visits.... kept trying to give it chances after chances... JUST GET CARROUT !"

They just melt in your mouth and are so simple but have so much in depth flavor. All the other food is great as well and it's a  great place to try new dishes including fried chicken skin nachos, rocky mountain oysters, etc. The drinks are phenomenal as well, especially their Moscow mule. Warning though, if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait up to an hour, possibly two, for a table inside. I will say though, it's more than worth the wait."

It doesn't seem like they pay too much attention to cleaning after each guest/customer even when it's not busy. It also doesn't have the 'sanitary' feel to it (sanitary grade 96.0). I noticed that not all the staff wear gloves/hair net/hat when handling food. Food it self doesn't look/taste fresh. I had the Noda salad for lunch and it tasted like it's been out all day. Great location - It seems like a good place to hang out and have coffee. However, based on my experience, I wouldn't order anything simply because I wouldn't wanna get sick.

The place is in a historic toe building with exposed wood rafters, exposed brick walls, eclectic light fixtures, and a peacock over the sushi bar.

There are also a collection of paninis thar sounds divine (but I didn't have enough room to sample). With all of this, there are also simple kebab options, and dip options. Then there's the sushi bar and menu. Yes, eclectic. But tasty and done well.\n\nCoctails are good, wine list is good, and the beer list seemed a bit short, but with more than enough liquors to make up for it.

Great breakfast all day items and I love that they have separate grills for meat and vegetarian items. Love the outdoor patio and that the restaurant is dog friendly. Service and professionalism need improvement. \n\nOn a recent visit, we sat outside (brought the dog; bad idea; July heat) and waited 5-10 minutes before receiving water (repeat... July heat) or menus. Not a great start...but OK. We then proceeded to sit for another 50 minutes before receiving our food.  \n\nThough the server apologized for the wait and explained a large table ordered just ahead of us inside the restaurant, the kitchen performance was also spotty...  Parts of the meal were freshly made; other items (ie biscuits and gravy) had heavily congealed; revealing it had sat ready for SOME TIME before it was served. Lines happen and kitchens get backed up; this is not the issue. I will wait for good food; just don't make me wait and then serve bad food.\n \nThe server was kind to us but had no problem complaining to a fellow staff member during our entire meal about a fellow server. Perhaps something to be dealt with behind closed doors?"

It turned out to be one the worst decisions that I made in my life. First of all, I was treated rudely by the front-desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there. Well, I admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places, but I still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several Spanish-speaking dudes who were checking out before me, and who were clearly pointing, looking, and making fun of me... However, I wouldn't give the place 1-star just for that reason alone. On top of that, the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago. I even found a hair in my eggplant, and ended up throwing away about half of the food. I will NEVER come there again. A good thing is that I don't even live anywhere remotely near this place."

The Pho (I had the first item in the Pho section) is very good. The broth is excellent and it didn't leave that MSG aftertaste so I know it was the real good stuff. The pancake is crispy and tasty.

Should have just gone to cowfish or something like usual but decided to try something different. It's not Iike I don't have a little bit of positive to say though, the manager was super nice and checked on us and if you are into crab they had a TON of that. I just am not and don't think you should pay a premium just because there is some crab on the buffet. Should be a separate price or something."

You people must be comparing this to Golden Corral or something. Maybe you don't know the cost of seafood, but anywhere that does unlimited seafood servings cost around $25 and up. I am from MD and even Phillips'(#1 seafood restaurant) charges $27 a person for the same service. Maybe you people need to stop dining out at places you can't afford"

But the Charlotte Marriott City Center gets 2 HUGE strikes right now. Never again. I've been here twice and both experiences have been very negative. \n\nOne...the 'mobile key' app they so-hyped since I checked in is glitchy and not ready for prime time. I spent about 5 minutes standing at my door trying to get it to open my door to no avail. I got a message on my phone saying go to the front desk to get a physical key. Their explanation? 'Oh, sometimes it's a little iffy'. You know what? Don't promote it and hype it until it is solidly working. Having worked in IT and dealing with mobile apps...terrible execution. \n\nTwo...I don't like housekeeping in my room, due to past bad experiences. I always put the 'Do not disturb' sign on, and someone from the hotel even saw me put it up this morning and acknowledged it. In my 18 years of reserving rooms myself, I've never had anyone come into my room after putting the sign on, in any type of hotel. But it happened today. Now I don't know who took the sign off, but someone did and all my stuff is now rearranged and I am not happy. So Marriott...it's on you or your clientele."

When I shopped at Northlake, it remember it having a Belk, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Macy's. Let me just say that the Macy's was a really clean store. Plenty of good clothing selection. Along with this, the mall's food court also had a diverse selection. The pizza spot there was very savory.\n\nAll in all, it's a good place to shop. They had a Sweet Spot store inside which I of course got a lot of candy. They also had a Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, and an AMC. Very enjoyable mall. \n\n- Bryce B."

Ordered Verde Veggie burrito w/Napolito salad and ate on patio on a very hot day. They bring table nachos w/a uniquely hearty corn salsa that tastes pretty good. PROS - Food was VERY fresh and very flavorful; server was EXTREMELY friendly; reggae tunes were mellow and set the beachfront Caribbean atmosphere; & despite 90\u00b0+ temps the patio somehow attracted a nice breeze. CONS (for me) - very old, grubby looking vintage walls, floor, & decor; and indoor seating tables are very close to each other."

On Friday and Saturday evenings, the mall's main entrance closest to the AMC Theatre becomes an outdoor gang recruitment center complete with cars playing music so loud you can't hear yourself think.\nThis 'scene' has led to two separate shooting incidents in the last two years - though not on weekend nights.  This past Christmas one of those incidents involved a shootout with a Charlotte Police Officer who killed the thug.\n \nThe variety of stores is still good, although there have been several stores that left.  Johnston & Murphy Men's Shoes, a high end store, closed, Italian restaurant BRAVO Cucina Italiana closed, among others."

The dumplings were delicious but I wish they had placed a few more on the plate. My entree came with the sushi roll we ordered and I felt like they didn't give me a proper portion. The rest of my friends had plenty of food filling their bowls, which were huge by the way. Who ever designed the menu really likes pineapple because almost every other item had pineapple in it. The sushi just didn't pan out like I was expecting it to. I know when dining in any city like Charlotte, food is going to be marked up. But, when that's the case, at least put some effort into it. The rice was too dry, and the vegetables in it were lacking their natural juices as well leaving the entire roll flavorless. Presentation was okay. It kinda looked like someone was in a rush when plating the sushi. Honestly you'd save more money and time going to Harris Teeter and grabbing some sushi and a bottle of wine. \n\nTL:DR\nSushi is better elsewhere and it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nAnd for God's sake, please get a new DJ. So many lame remixes of current pop songs set to an 80's bass track"

It was very noisy, TVs were everywhere it seemed and there obviously was no dress code. I did not see any of the usual wait staff, most seemed new and inexperienced for a quality establishment. The entrees: poor quality meat, over seasoned and undercooked. One of our sides still had not arrived by the time we had finished so we cancelled the order. The waiter barely graced our presence, never offered to refresh our beverages and we had to repeatedly request utensils and napkins that were not set prior to our being seated. After we ordered the lemon cake , he disappeared before we could ask for coffee or after dinner drinks and only returned to bring the bill. Just a note on your signature dessert- stale, hard and crusty...at least a few days old. We did speak to the manager about the terrible experience. He quickly became defensive, perhaps even a little argumentative when a simple apology would have sufficed."

The place had a number of tables and most were empty. I was long after the lunch hour. The staff were very nice,  but I wasn't expecting my food to take as long as it did. Maybe 8-10 minutes. I'm okay with this kind of wait but my preconceived notion was to expect a Panara sub 5 minute meal. Definitely worth it and didn't subtract from my experience.  I wish that there were locations in my part of the country as I would definitely eat at them."

There was a group of young men who were seated that didn't have a waitress attend to them until 15 minutes after and had not gotten drinks. \nBefore leaving there was a group of young adults who were waiting to be seated three different times because the tables were still dirty. Service was very slow and innitentive. \n\nThat being said, our waitress was very nice and the food is always wonderful. So it's a win-lose."

I felt because i am not a regular they just sort of ignored me. I ordered  my burger med rare.  At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it. All and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut\u00e9ed spinach was good"

Our table on the other hand was very dirty but our waitress looked at us like if we're crazy and told US that the table was clean. We had to ask 3 times for them to clean, but it was only grudgingly. Our sodas came quickly and we were advised that there was a wait so we expected only a 30 min wait maximum. For some measly stale and unseasoned burgers along with 3' straw thin  French fries it was not worth the time nor the money. \nPutting up with it due to the inclement weather, we could see into the kitchen and notice that the employees were going slow as if there was not a full house. This of course, infuriated us more. How a business can keep making the same mistake of running on low lethargic staff on such a busy night is beyond me."

Second shift was the absolute worse. We were always busy but our greedy managers had us low on staff. None of the employees were valued therefore no one saw value in their job. As a waitress you get paid $2.13 hourly. The tips were okay but it just didn't seem worth it when your managers don't schedule a person to do dishes, shakes etc. all night and expect you to work overtime with out being paid!!! I go to college for a reason and it's so I NEVER have to work in an environment like this, just TERRIBLE!!\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29"

I was ignored for 12 minutes while waiting to pit in my order an older man came in 9 minutes after me and was seated, greater and his order was taken before mine. Finally I got to order. The food was not good for the price, the chicken salad was boring, the bread was old and stale. The sweet potato mash was watery, stringy and bland. If this restaurant was not a 501C3 designation I would have refused to pay the food was that bad. I don't know if it because I'm a single woman I got treated so badly or what. I can only compare my treatment to the man sitting 1 chair down from me. Sadly I will no longer be recommending this business to my friends and family nor will I be returning."

This location (as well as the location in CMC/Levine hospital down the street) apparently are needing some training as well as system updates, maybe? I placed an order online for rapid pick-up. It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told 'We're out of that souffl\u00e9. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.' I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese souffl\u00e9 so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund.

Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).

The waitress told us the specials, but when we went to order, found out that 1/3 of the menu was not available because they were out. She did not offer substitutions or other options, which we heard her give other guests. The food was barely average, and the grits notably came out barely warm.

The hostess was very polite.  She told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time.  Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.  I would never leave no tip even with horrible service.  I am very disappointed.  I know $9 is not a lot of money to some but again I did NOT authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill."

Wine and beer was advertised as included but there were only 2 terrible over crafted beers available from a distributor who seemed to be there to sell their swill.  The wines too were generic and low quality from the same distributor.  So that whole aspect was a sales pitch.  For $95, I'm done buying.\n\nThe oyster selection was incredible (at least in terms of presentation)  Ice bins were setup everywhere with placards on them naming where the oysters came from around the country.  By the time you returned to your seat, you had forgotten the places where they came from and they all looked and tasted the same.  Not to mention that all of them were small and had no real heartiness or depth of flavor.\n\nOther selections were fried oysters (over breaded and void of any oyster flavor), oysters Rockefeller (fine enough), and a clam crostini (too fishy)\n\nAfter about an hour of eating what were essentially appetizers, you realize that's it.  There is no real food included even though the advertised menu suggest there is some opportunity to make a meal out of it (and why wouldn't there be, it's $95 so I 'm going into it thinking it is a meal) .  But they don't even give you bread to at least fool you into thinking you ate a meal.\n\nOverall, with the alcohol included, it is probably at most a $55 a head event considering you will still have to go out for dinner afterwards."

Prime rib was medium rare but still tougher than a $2 steak. Oysters you could tell were frozen and were extremely slimy. I'm in the business so I understand the concept of trying to maximize profit, but this was just a rip off. $40 and $20 for kids i was expecting much much better. We will never return and I would give 0 stars if possible"

Had to go ask for our server to come so we could get things we needed. Server didn't come back till about 10 min after we finished eating.  Food wasn't impressive either, just so so."

Rubbery shrimp made the dish barely edible. The sauce it came with was good, albeit generic. Servers were pretty busy, but really nice. Did not get silverware with my appetizer and server forgot bread I asked for. Overall the service was good and it's an okay place to go if you are looking for that restaurant chain experience with generic food (guilty pleasure)."

I just love that Ruby Tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce!  :)   They seated all 8 of us pretty quickly, service was good, and the food was consistent.\nPositives: Pretty good salad bar (they have spinach!), healthy side choices, consistently good food.\nNegatives: They were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky."

Specials most days of the week, and routinely there are special tappings or events with rare beers. If you like beer, and are in the University area, this should be your place to go.\n\nCome find me there. I'm the loud, bald, fat man there on Monday nights. Let's have a beer."

Throughout my night there, in excess of thirty women were up on top of the speakers on the dancefloor dancing, which was absolutely fine and accepted by all staff. However, when a male friend of mine got up to dance he was told to get down and leave the venue. A huge double standard and very sexist. When another friend tried to peacefully reason with the secuirty staff, simplyto keep our friend in the venue he was suddenly, without warning put into a full headlock by the 230 pound staff member. So here we have a placid, peaceful 170 pound man absolutely manhandled, rammed head first into the floor, laid on top of, once again with hugely excessive force. The whole time his hands above his head offering no resistance. He was then picked up by a second security staff, the two thugs combining to ram his head into a pillar as he was removed from the premises, comolete with a split head and very very confused to what had happened. Disgraceful security, and the manager when asked to be spoken to was not interested at all, obviously supporting thuggery more than friendly business. Huge regrets for spending any of my hard earned money here."

Service was okay and my wife enjoyed the ravioli but my steak was bad.  You can get a decent sirloin from anywhere and for an equal or better price.  It was the most pathetic steak I have ever been served.  So, I broke two life records today.  Longest wait for a meal and worst steak ever.  $40.  I will be getting the ravioli to go for my wife (calling it in at least an hour early) but will never sit down at that place again.  0 stars for me but plus 2 on behalf of my wife."

Neither are what I consider dinner atmosphere. The menu is such a hodgepodge of food. We thought with the name 'Lure' we were going to have a great seafood selection, we were wrong. The Blue Point oysters we ordered were mushy. Hard pass. And the calamari were boring and cold. Pass on these, too. And that's when we decided we should just cut our losses and head somewhere else. The wait staff is nice and helpful. Bless their hearts.  \n\nIn short, are they a seafood resturant? A diner? A pool hall? A club? I'm not sure and don't think I will be back to find out."

The Asiago crab dip was a great recommendation as well as the carrot cake for desert. Great suggestive selling. Our entrees were out in less than twenty minutes. We even had a couple of managers stop in periodically to check on us. I think their names were Nick and Kevin. Great guys. I am a mystery shopper by trade and always take notes on my visits.

He said they are not NUTs they are pumpkin nuts. While eating my salad my mouth started burning. I was having an allergic reaction. I didn't know why. I asked my husband to google pesto. Pesto has PINE NUTS in them. We told Jordan and he said that pesto at Bonefish Grill does not have NUT. I then asked for hot tea. My allergic reaction made me nauseated so I rushed home. When I googles Bonefish Pesto this morning this I what I found \n\n1 cup basil leaves\n1/4 cup Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup PINE NUTS\n2 garlic cloves, chopped\n1/4 tsp salt\n6 Kalamata olives\n1/4 cup olive oil\n\nI think servers should be knowledgeable about the items they are serving.

I want to walk away from that feeling like 'That was incredible and I can't wait to go again'. That is not even close to what we felt. We got the 'newbie' waiter, so the service was not top notch. We were told the special came with a white wine sauce, only to overhear another waiter tell his guests that it was a red sauce. Sure enough, it came out with a red sauce. If the price of the meal was in the $60 range I might not be so critical. But when you pay what I consider to be a pretty pricey cost...add to that the fact that the $9 glass of wine came from an $8 bottle (it was good wine, but I don't need to be clubbed over the head on the transaction), I would say it was just 'ok'. Nothing to write home about, and certainly not worth going back to when there are so many other great places in the area."

I watched as three different sets of customers at three different tables wityh our same server came in after us and were seated and served food and drinks and even dessert! while we continued to wait!!! I had water and my cup was refilled ONCE durning the entire hour and a half i was there( yes my cup was EMPTY), my boys didn't get a refill until after me. After our waitress came to the table ONCE to apologize for the long wait between ordering drinks and appitizers then our food i finally asked her was there a reason our table was getting such poor service? her response to me was ' im sorry i had other tables and i had to close a big group out' i asked for the manager and explained to him the issue and he had no response or an apology!!! oh but he comped my appitizers all of ten dollars on an 80.00 BILL!!!!!!!!!! They wont be seeing again. I give them a zero."

We waited outside because it was standing room only. 70 minutes later I returned to the hostess stand and noted there was NO ONE waiting other than us. The Hostess was dumbstruck when I asked how much longer. She said there were no guests waiting/unseated. She asked me 3 times for my name and number in my party. She finally told me to go into the bar and she would find a server. I'll quickly bullet the rest on the evening:\n- not given water after asking\n- received drinks 20 minutes after ordering\n- 1 refill required extreme effort and 1 hour\n- food was cafeteria quality\n- server was superficially smiling but obviously perturbed\n- drunk panhandler was greeted by the barmaid by name. Larry then proceeded to ask table after table of diners for gas money. 4th table complained to the barmaid who finally asked Larry to leave.\n- salad refill never arrived.\n\nPreviously 3 stars:\nAsk for Server Lynette. She's the best!\nAvoid the Talapia. I suspect seafood ain't generally their strong suit"

The drinks themselves could be served better.  \n\nNow I'm not one to be a drink sob, when you wanna get a good buzz on, then serve is however you can.  But when you ask for a Jager Bomb or an Irish Car Bomb, then I think their  respective shots should drop/bomb into the drink.  In theory, that would happen if the shot was in..say...a shot glass.  They served the shot is a plastic medicine cup.  That makes it difficult to drink/bomb/enjoy.  The shot was just floating in the pint glass.\n\nDoes anyone remember Exxon Valdez?  Plastic is made of oil, and oil floats.\n\nAlso, one more thing.   The music is so damn loud, that I can't hear myself think about how loud the music is.  \n\nI understand...It tries to be classy, what with the guy in the bathroom handing you paper towels, like a posh NYC night club...but this is a bowling alley.\n\nAn Alley."

        "Review": "Was a great atmosphere at first. Then one of the bar tenders was giving a girl who lost her keys a hard time, after she came up to the bar and politely asked if anyone turned in some keys she had lost. After not checking if the keys were turned in, and initially saying 'no', he began to respond with things like, 'it's not my f***ing responsibility if you lost your keys',  'I don't have your keys you f***ing stupid b**ch,' and 'stop giving me attitude about your keys' (when she clearly wasn't). I was standing right next to her, and after repeated comments like this, I'd heard enough and said, 'hey man, the girl lost her keys, and logigically just wants to know if anyone returned them here, what is your problem?' He immediately grabs me by the shirt and asks me 'What the f***k are you going to do about it?' (something I don't think was necessary, at all, at this point). He proceeds to call over security who says, 'Hey let's talk about this over here' (pointing to a spot away from the bar). I agreed saying, 'yes, let's talk about it' (after being very displeased with being grabbed by the shirt, by an overly aggressive bar tender). Security proceeds to push me out a side door without saying a word. If this is the kind of bar you would like to go to, then I highly recommend it."

Our server was M.I.A.for the majority of my time there. Beers came out after the food even though they were ordered at the same time. Bartenders could not have cared less about a single customer. Big applause to the hostess, who did a fantastic job greeting customers, running food, bussing tables, and trying to smooth over guests. A large thank you to the one server (not named Ashleigh) who stepped in and took care of us and not-too-thrilled customers around us. Food was defiantly on point, especially for 11pm and the cooks getting ready to shut down the kitchen. That did a lot. Our personal server was rude and I understand it was busy, I work in the industry too but it does not excuse the fact of making a customer feel like they are a bother. If it wasn't for the competency of the rest of the staff it would have been a disaster. Would have been nice to see some sort of manager on the floor trying to save the sinking ship."

        "Review": "To be quite honest service is poor.. \nI've attented this resturant few times. \nAt first they treated me as a costumer should be treated. It wasn't until later that i was treated very poorly. maybe it was a change of mangement or a change of waitress but the behavior i've incounter is unacceptable. I would come in sit down and it would take about an hour for the waitress to even bring my drinks out. I was patient until I realized that she didnt bring my drink out because she was too busy singing along side with another waitress. As a resturant manger or owner i would seek for my employee to do their job before even thinking of singing or side tracking. (but of course thats just me) \nSecond, when my family & i have been drinking all night and decided we want something in our stomach they refuse to serve us because the 'kitchen was close' and they were trying to close early keep in mind this was 1 hour and a half  before closing time but even then that didn't much bother us i know what its like to work at night and just want to go home but i kid you not it wasn't until a group of high school student walked in and order food that it got to me .. they refuse to serve my family & i but served them no questions asked? I THINK NOT .. an apologe was not even giving to us. \nThirdly, the  DJ is really disrespectful to costumers today i saw him push a young lady that looked as if she was asking for a song. I as a lady found it distastful to see a manger accept such behavior for an employee. As an employer i would seek for both more respectful waitress and dj .. \nThis resturant is a disappointment big time.  I would be damned if i step foot here again. I do NOT recommend anyone to go here i did give them a fair shoot and they disappointed me everytime!."

Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

There was also a dog some rooms down barking and we contacted the front desk the first time they ignored,but the second time they said we could move down a few rooms. That did not make a difference.

        "Review": "Stayed here for one night recently with family for a soccer tournament.  My biggest problem with this particular location was the overflowing garbage cans outside (which I told them about several times) and the laundry/cleanup carts that were around in the halls when we arrived (after 6pm).  In general, they seemed to have a problem with the cleaning staff.  But our room was clean, so that is good.  This is your typical Hyatt Place, so if you are familiar with the brand and layout, you know what to expect.  The lobby is a bit small and was cramped at breakfast, but they opened up a conference room so that was helpful.  This hotel in particular has a very small area around the elevators (which are in the hallways right behind the front desk, also used for access to/from the lobby and other rooms).   This was definitely a problem during high traffic times, you had to constantly move out of the way while waiting for the elevators.  Very poor layout in my opinion.  Otherwise, the rooms are exactly as you would expect for a Hyatt Place, so if you like the layout it will be the same.   I really like the sitting area, it's quite large and has a big L-shaped sofa and a separate desk.  Really nice!   The only thing I don't like about these rooms is the 'open' bathroom area.  The sink is basically in the bedroom so it's very hard to get ready for bed or get up early and get ready (like brushing your teeth) without disturbing anyone else who might be sleeping.   But if everyone gets up and goes to bed at the same time, no problem.\nNegatives: Small lobby and breakfast area (cramped if busy), overflowing trash cans outside, a lot of laundry/cleaning carts in hallways, very cramped elevator location.\nPositives: Large rooms, new, modern, room was clean and quiet."

        "Review": "First, I would like to say that the front desk staff members do an outstanding job. Lucy, is an angel. It meant the world to me that she helped my grandma make her tea. I know grandma CAN do it herself, but we encourage her to let us help her.  For anyone that looks after someone who has needs, the little things mean the world to people who take care of them. From the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. \n\nHowever, Hyatt needs to supply this particular hotel with additional front end people. It is not fair for the staff to deal with so many people (especially at night), as well as making guest wait for periods of time with out being helped.  Bottom line is that more evening staff members would be helpful to this location.\n\nThere was some confusion or miscommunication about the room I had booked. I booked a two bed room, and what I received was a one bed room with a pull out couch. The other rooms were not available due to cleaning service being understaffed. Truth be told, I was not stoked to sleep on the floor on Friday for $140 a night. However, we were able to move rooms on Saturday. \n\nHyatt! Spend the money and supply your staff team!\n\nHotel policy's are a 'hit and miss'.  What I mean is that you may not be charged for a particular policy one stay, but be charged for it another time. \n\nThere is apparently a $30 'damage fee' to cover any hotel property if ruined.  I was not charged this fee before, so it was a surprise when it showed up on the bill. However, the kind desk manager, Joel, was able to remove it. \n\nThis is my second time at this hotel, and both times I had my dog. The first time I was not charged $75 (even after offering to put proof of rabies vaccine on file). For the record, the dog is well behaved.  When I asked the manager (name?) about it, he simply told me that it was policy. I told the manager I understood, but if there if a policy, follow through with it at all times. He removed it, but honestly, the money didn't matter. It is more important that I can be informed.  I was frustrated. I felt like I was being  'dismissed' from the conversation by having the charge dropped. I want to be informed so I am prepared for the charge on my bill. \n\nBottom line, if you have a policy, follow through with it at all times. Inconsistency kills a business. I do not like to be surprised with 'fees' I was not informed of, nor charged for during my previous stay at this particular hotel. \n\nI don't get to see my family as often as I like since I took a job in Florida, so these trips are special to us. I chose Hyatt because it is a higher end type of hotel that has been recommended by close friends. I chose this particular location due to other customer reviews. My first visit compared to my last visit was night and day. \n\nWhen I left, I felt like we were an inconvenience to the hotel. I am a client who like to 'have it together' as far as reservations and what to expect. I set this trip up for my family, and I feel like I failed them. \n\nIt was good to see old friends and family during my visit, but the hotel was not a nice stay."

There was LOUDDDD laughing, cackling, screaming and talking coming from the kitchen. My silverware had dried on egg on it. My plate came with some red jam on my bacon and eggs (there was nothing on my plate that had any red jam on it). Food was disgusting.

Great food, decent wine selection for a local bar and the best staff on East Blvd. My regular eats here are the excellent chicken wings (try the Gold Rush sauce), the beef on 'weck (I haven't eaten this anywhere else so have nothing to compare it to, but it's excellent), the fish and chips (crispy batter, flaky haddock, fantastic). Can't decide?...get the fish and chips and beef on 'weck combo every Sunday. Great patio right on East, where you can relax with a cold drink and watch the world go by. Tuesday night is Trivia Night and it can be a little loud for talking, but it's not too bad if you sit at the bar."

He turned his head and went the other way. My daughter went to talk to him about how he acted, because she's a manager. She explained to him the issues we had and he walked away from her leaving her standing at the hostess area(front door).\n\nOur waiter Matt was great and apologized throughout the night.

Then the salty bacon, the sweet jd's BBQ sauce paired with a medium flavor cheese and a salty crispy onion ring gave me something I was not expecting...pure mouth joy. The semi floppy  (requested) chips had this seasoning (salty, peppery sweet) that were amazing, too.

        "Review": "This was my second time visiting 5Church; the experience was underwhelmingly satisfactory. The hostess, Juliana, was very pleasant and helpful as I was traveling from Columbia for dinner. After being seated at 7:15 on Monday evening, it wasn't until 7:45 before we had our drinks. We reluctantly had to ask the hostess to put in our appetizer orders. We had the Yellowfin tuna tartare and the charcuterie board which were well balanced and flavorful. Yet, it was still a constant struggle for service. \n\nOur server got our entree orders wrong and failed to bring out our 2nd round of drinks after multiple times of us requesting them. He also didn't come see us after we received our meal so I didn't get to eat what I ordered. I had the 10oz filet with bordelaise, which had fantastic flavor and texture - the bordelaise was a perfect accompaniment. To no surprise, paying the bill was just a difficult. \n\nTo my knowledge, the restaurant was launching a new menu tonight, which, understandably, could be problematic for some servers. The problem was that we routinely saw our waiter pass us to help out the other tables around us, yet he repeatedly neglected to attend to our table. I expect more in terms of service when I pay $120 for a dinner for two. It pained me to even leave a decent tip. The food, on the contrary, was phenomenal - which is why I gave the rating 2 stars. The interior had a very upbeat and lively atmosphere."

The Wagyu steak was good, but I could do better for cheaper.  Another dish we were served was barely-cooked vegetables.  Everyone was appropriately apologetic, but due to the slow service and limited vegetable options, we had to just leave it.  My recommendation to the place?  Less expensive fancy cuts of meat and more attention to the easy details -- like cooking vegetables!\n\nIf you want to try something new in Charlotte, you might want to move this one down the list til they can sort their kitchen issues."

If you like hot tea I would highly recommend getting a pot of their hot tea. It is delicious and some of the best tea I have had. I'm not a big burger fan so I've only stuck with the sushi here. They have some nice combinations and some good options if you want to stay away from anything fried (although fried anything is so good).  My favorite so far is the tropical storm roll because it comes with a decent amount of fish and a nice sauce. If you want an appetizer, the tuna-Tini is really good and is a pretty good portion.

Knew it would be busy but we were in no hurry and the weather was great. All was going fine until we received our food. I ordered a chicken sandwich and the presentation was nice and the fruit salad was beautiful. However the chicken was undercooked and disgusting, completely killed my appetite and nearly caused me to get sick. The texture!!! I know what cooked chicken is supposed to taste like and this was not it. I hate sending food back and reluctantly told my server that the chicken was undercooked. He looked at it and insisted it was fine, that it's how the cook it on the flat top or something like that. He did not even offer an alternative or an apology at all- just snatched my plate up and walked away. I sat there for 20 more minutes with no food while the rest of my party enjoyed their pancakes and omelettes. He completely ignored me for the rest of the meal, as if I had done something wrong. I noticed the sandwich was taken off the bill so I guess they figured all was settled. But I take poor service and lack of pride in serving edible meals to be a big deal. I won't be returning to this establishment ever again."

They cater as well and the food is just as good as getting it at the restaurant. The cheese muffins there bring out before you order are to die for. You can buy the mix to make your own at home along with other dressings and spices they offer for purchase."

Finally got things sorted and had a pretty decent dinner. Food came out non-stop and all of the meats were good. The salad bar was a little lack luster and didn't provide many sides for the meat course. Overall it was a good night."

I've been to quite a few....But I've never tasted BBQ like this ever before in my life. Jim and Nicks was introduced to me last December. They catered our Christmas Employee Appreciation Dinner. I was sold. Shortly afterwards, I visited the restaurant to try other food items. I have yet to be disappointed. Everyone there is always friendly. I LOVE JIM AND NICKS! I wish there was one closer to home. But it's always a treat to have that smoked tender BBQ. And the Mac and Cheese is to die for. Everything homemade, even the pickles....love the pickles....\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f"

I'm aware it is often hard to pinpoint where this illness came from, but the fact that this is the one place my husband and I both ate at makes it clear to me. We also began feeling bad around the same time frame. I wasn't calling to receive free food (we don't live anywhere near a Jim N Nick's), we were just trying to make management aware."

I visited Chima last week with some friends and I would say that if you are hungry for some good food and enjoy good customer service then you should visit them soon. The experience was good from the moment you walk into their beautiful establishment. Greeted with warm smiles and hostesses eager to take care of your needs. The mood is nice with the dimmed lights and soft music. The service is good. No waiting at your table for a long period of time for your waitress. Orders are there in a timely manner, and table is cleared almost instantly. The meat is circulating around like clockwork and is always hot and juicy with flavors that melt in your mouth. Their salad bar features many different options of salads from Mixed Greens to Pasta salads. It also provides fruit and a variety of cheese and rice. At the table, they bring many different side dishes, which is something I haven't experienced at a Brazilian Steak House before. Even the management is out and walking around making sure your visit is a wonderful one. I did however, had an issue with the valet parking I didn't get as stated on their website(update site with start time). My waitress did send a manager my way, he explained the rule(law) that the states has about valet parking(knowledge) and even offered to split the cost for the parking deck payment. I was all smiles after that. I left Chima  happy, stuff and could barely walk but satisfied with the outcome overall. Chima, you will see me again. Thank you for a wonderful evening.By the way, try the Brazilian soda called Guarana Antarctica...SO GOOD"

Did I mention it is all you can eat? Tons of different meats to choose from and cooked all different ways. Try as many as you like or as few as you like, however I recommend trying as many as you can. Expensive, however for the amount of food you get (as much as you want), it is much more bang for your buck than some of the other high end restaurants around town. Extremely fun and interesting atmosphere as well, every visit is another great experience!"

We met with the event coordinator, Kay Emad, and squared away all details for the day. Kay assured me that every detail we discussed would be met on the day of. When we arrived at the venue on the day of our event, Kay was  nowhere to be found and the room was set up nothing like we had originally discussed. The wait staff was helpful in helping us set the room up and in serving our guests. There was not one time during the evening that Kay came to greet my husband and I. At the conclusion of our evening we received our bill for a significantly higher amount than we had planned out. Because we were so wrapped up in our guests we did not realize that we had been grossly overcharged an additional  $400 until the next day. We called and emailed Kay and she never returned our call or corresponded with us again. Fortunately, the server from that night corrected the egregious error and returned our funds. The unprofessional demeanor of Kay did not take away from our beautiful evening, and it may not take away from yours either. Just be cautious of the fees printed on your final bill, and be aware of the lack of communication and consideration that you may recieve."

I asked the server for extra crispy wings upon placing my order and the wings were white in some areas looking as if they were baked. Very soft and soggy. A basic franchise like Wing Stop has better wings and also Hickory Tavern with their old bay wings. Hopefully this can be fixed."

My wife was in regular shoes and not participating in any ice skating activities but was still injured. Management of the facility is hiding behind their signs in the facility and hidden on their website of not 'being responsible for any injuries suffered in skating activities'. I was not aware that talking to someone in an area away from any ice was an 'activity'. This should serve as a warning to all entering this facility that you have to watch yourself here even when not skating as they have no rules that say you should not wear blades in non skating areas. Accidents are very likely to happen during crowded times if this is not mandated."

The atmosphere is fancy enough that you can impress a date but casual enough that you two won't feel out of place if you come in jeans and use a salad fork for your entree.\n\nThere isn't one mean server in the house. They are all friendly (Robbie is the best!) and I'm always impressed with how well they know the menu. I'm not a huge drinker so I'm always ordering virgin drinks. I've never had a non alcoholic drink that didn't taste like a cool spring breeze lol (Rachel is the bartender I like). \n\n You don't wait long for food, it comes out exactly when it should. Speaking of food, I rate it a ten. \n\nTop 3 Apps\n- Aria Caesar Salad (keep the anchovies, I promise they work really well with it. I used to be a no anchovies kinda girl too)\n- Gnocchi (the appetizer, I haven't tried the spinach gnocchi entree yet)\n- SHAVED KALE SALAD!!! PERFECTOOOOO!!\n\nTop 3 Entrees\n- Spaghetti and Meatballs\n- The steak is awesome, if you have a little money to blow.\n- FETTUCCINE CARBONARA! add blackened shrimp and thank Robbie for the bomb suggestion.\n\nBest dessert award goes to the Blackberry Cheesecake! Hands down! \n\nMake sure you get a cappuccino and ask Dennis (the hottest guy ever) for some whipped cream. Thank me later ladies. :)\n\nBottom line, Aria rocks! Great food, great music, and the greatest service ever. Make a reservation if you can because they do fill up fast some nights, even though I never make one and always get a table (but it's purely good luck). Make sure you try the bread, cause Lorrrrdddddd it's the best."

The week before that I was in around 6pm and ordered Salmon and the middle was raw, raw. I was eating at the Lucky Texan about 3 times every two weeks. I have now switched to Outback on Independence and have eaten there twice in last two weeks. Steaks excellent , service good. John, owner of TRH should have been a little nicer because when he came out he brought the steak and stood with arms folded like the meal a grudge match. Owner should be a little more humble and not act like the customer in the wrong. He never apologized to me so I took it that he did not care if I came back.

As you walk in you are expecting a server to come and sit you down because of the linen tables, no one come we stood there for about 10 mins, the cashiers were behind the counter and didn't acknowledge us. (this is the first time we came to this place) We looked at the menu and went up to the cashier to tell her our order, when our food came out she didn't bring out the fries we had ordered (which you have to pay 1.99 extra for) we informed her of this and she said she did not charge us for it so we weren't getting them. We started to eat and noticed our chicken was not cooked all the way, the plantains weren't cooked either and the rice was COLD. It was almost closing time so another customer came in and sat down and ate and they started turning off everything on us, because they were closing, as I was filling up my drink I noticed that they were just re-heating the food in the microwave for these other customers that they had taken out of the refrigerator. NASTY! The food is not fresh and not even cooked all the way and they just re-heat everything. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE!"

(Jasmine) This time she had no problem talking to me when i said i wanted to cancel my order. 'OK!

They did away with our favorite salmon dish and changed to some other fish that was inedible. Presentation was beyond basic - the fish was on an essentially empty plate. Service was some of the worst I've ever had - the lady couldn't understand anything. Not to mention, we had planned a birthday surprise, dropping off cake and candles before dinner. The waitress literally came out and asked the entire table 'Should I put the candles in the cake or do you guys want to do it?'. Ruining the entire surprise for the birthday. Won't be back here."

The blackened swordfish special was exceptional, even better than the similar special I enjoyed only a week earlier in Nags Head. My wife had the shrimp pasta and loved it as well.\n\nTo top off the excellent food, we had great service, including the struggles that come from eating out with a toddler. \n\nThe only thing I can nit-pick is that the seating was uncomfortable to me, but I wasn't thinking much about that as I enjoyed my meal. \n\nThanks for a great experience for our anniversary!"

The shrimp cocktail was so overcooked you could bounce it off a wall. We ordered the trout with lobster hash and there was no lobster in the hash. The server argued and said the Chef said it had lobster. Fyi my family is from Maine and knew there was no lobster. The crembroulet was ice cold and tasted store bought. When we questioned the server as to why the crembroulet was served cold she became defensive and lied to us by stating she had told us before hand that it was served cold. The peach cobbler was cold had no cobbler or crumble and tasted like canned peaches with store bought ice cream.  This experience embarrassed me for having to bring my family and friends to such a low level high priced dinner.  Never again."

I call it a 'Rock and Rolls' lunch.The real treat is to come here for dinner in the evening. The chef's choice sashimi bowl is amazing. High quality and a higher price, but well worth it."

        "Review": "1 of 5 stars Pending review\nMy husband and i ate here on jan 1,2016 and the food was awful. i had grouper with potato hash and collard greens. The grouper was raw in the middle and overcooked on the edges. If that wasn't bad enough they had a very strong acidic sauce over everything on the plate. It was so overbearing I couldn't taste the potatoes or the collards. I called the waitress over and told her I could not eat it and she asked if there was anything else that I wanted and i said no just take it off the bill. Now since this restaurant is listed as an 'upscale' restaurant you would have thought that a manager would have come over to see what the problem was. Well I guess not as no one came so i guess they don't really care what the customer thinks of their food or service just as long as they pay the price and put money in their pocket. We also had a 'cup' which was really more of a large shot glass of shrimp & lobster bisque and there wasn't a piece of shrimp or lobster in the so called soup it was very thin and very salty. We paid the bill but since they don't seem to care for their customers comments i will never be going there again. on the way home I was reading their reviews and wished that I had done that before going as there were many bad reviews.\n\nVisited January 2016"

Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

She replied that it wasn't to her liking that it was very dry, bland and not very good at all. The waiter asked if she was done with it and she said yes. He removed the dish from the table. He didn't even offer to remove the dish or reduce the bill for the meal. We will never eat at this restaurant ever again. My advice would be to look elsewhere for Mexican food.

That's the best advice, I suppose.\n\nAim away from peak hours, for better service, and I personally would not recommend the chicken and waffles, especially for the price - I'm not sure how a restaurant in the south is going to mess up Fried Chicken, but they managed to make the chicken skin and breading heavy and unappetizing, and the waffle was nothing special. To make matters worse, it was served vertically, on a spike, without any clear way to approach it.\n\nI'm rambling. My general view of the menu is that it's focusing too much on being gourmet, and not enough on being... well, GOOD. Another reviewer got it spot-on - the menu is essentially heavy and overpriced tapas.\n\nGreat and (slowly) rotating selection of Belgian and farmhouse style beers, one of the better places for the style in Charlotte if that's what you're into (which is what earns it the third star), but the establishment as a whole is far more focused on catering to a crowd that's used to the city's higher-end dining and nightlife. If you've got money to burn on food or mixed drinks, or you're just here for the beer, you could do worse than a night at Heist."

You will smell like you stood by the deep fryer and cooked your own meal after you leave, so word up."

I called to make reservations, CHEDDARS doesn't do reservations. Not to mention the 1 hour wait and to still be broken up into different  sections is oblivious.

Nice relaxed atmosphere. Good beer selection, with an emphasis on the locals; the cocktails we tried were also very good. The food here is tapas-style, so my wife and I split 5 plates which were all amazing and more than enough. Shout-out to our bartender, Wolf(w\u00fclf?), who made this a 5-star experience. By a mile the best service we had in the city during our stay."

She would walk by and not say a thing - how are you doing/refills...NOTHING (I had to ask her to do things). She only came to my table about two/three times before checking-out. I guess the young girls that work in this restaurant feel they need to cater to a specific population, but this place isn't even high end dining to kiss that much a**.

After a recent renovation the place looks really good, but the service has fallen off a cliff. Waited 40 minutes for a standard lunch order to get to the table and the place was not even half full. There were at least 5 people working back in the kitchen -- I know because I finally had to go to the kitchen counter to ask to pay my bill so I could leave. Who has 1 hour and 10 minutes to get a salad lunch with a glass of water? The buffalo chicken on my salad consisted of 4 nuggets dipped in sauce. Oh, and to top it off I was charged full price for a kid's meal, which is an advertised special to be free on Tuesdays! I did not have my wits about me to compute that until I had already paid and left. So $44 for 2 adults and one kid to have lunch, including a 10% tip I gave the server purely as a courtesy. Between the food and the service it was barely worth half of that. Too bad to see this place go downhill with no attempt to make things right or compensate the customer."

The person who ordered the seafood gumbo had been served the sausage gumbo and vice versa.  As this could potentially be a fatal mistake for somebody with a shellfish allergy I address the mix up with the wait staff, who's only reply was 'yes, the kitchen gets this wrong all the time' .

Dragon Court is truly ethnic, offering the real deal.  Loved the food and environment.

I had to remind her 3 times that I wanted lemon with my water. We ordered water and tea and were not offered any refills until it was time for us to pay. I mean come on! It's water and tea. Any other restaurant would stay on top of that and make sure that the glass is never empty. The waitress got the orders wrong even after she so called wrote it down. She did not stop by our table to make sure that everyone was OK. It seemed that she was hiding in a dark corner and only came out when she felt it was necessary. Any other waitress that actually worked for their tip would provide excellent customer service and at least attempt to engage in conversation with the customers. This lady did absolutely nothing until it was time to pay. She then made a sorry attempt to make small talk with us. We were given a review card before leaving. The experience was OK but we would most likely never eat at that location again because that waitress ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot!

I got the hangar steak and the beets and both were absolutely covered in salt. My chest ached before I finished the meal probably because my heart felt assaulted. My boyfriend's corn was extremely salty as well.\n\nIn addition, the a la carte style means that you're going to be spending a good chunk of your paycheck there. My meal alone was $30 and it was probably 6 oz. of steak and beets and that's IT.\n\nI wish I could get my money back..."

Their regular prices are not out of line with their food quality and portions. Average dinner entr\u00e9e seems to be $17.\n\nMy salmon was perfectly done; most evenly cooked I'd ever had at a restaurant. The almond rice was fantastic in the reisling sauce from the salmon. The Wurstplatte was as expected, and fried potatoes with bacon was quite tasty and different. \n\nThe Heisse Liebe desert (vanilla ice cream with warm raspberry sauce & 'Peach Schnapps,' topped with homemade whipped cream) was incredibly flavorful, while the Apfelstrudel was understated but better than many."

Trust me, the Optimator tastes much better on draft, along with the rest.  I've never left this place hungry, and I've yet to be disappointed with the food or service after going here for the past 15 years or so.  Be warned, German beer is not Miller lite.  If you're drinking a liter or more, make sure you're not driving.  Pretzel bread, there is none better.  Also, much more reasonable prices than similar restaurants in Charlotte, for both food and beer.  Most of what I prefer is between $15 and $20, but there are also some worthwhile options in the low to mid twenties."

Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of 'ethnic names and poor accents' and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.

She stunk. Took our drink order and didn't really have very good table skills. The questions were unintelligent and what I would expect from someone offering me 'fries with that'....She came back with the drinks after making a few pits stops along the way. Keep in mind we were the only table she was serving.\n\nPlaced our order and while waiting for said order our drinks went dry. All the while she was standing by the kitchen doing much of nothing. \n\nOur order arrived and it was OK. $15 for Chicken Parm...and it was OK. Not worth the $15 price tag. The menu is huge and complicated. Way too big. They need to trim it up.\n\nAgain the drinks went dry. All while about 3 or 4 of wait staff sat around doing nothing. Trash all over the floor no service and all of them sitting down doing nothing. \n\nSo on the way out the door I mentioned this to the 'manager' and he didn't seems upset or concerned and at no point apologized for the crappy service.

I was simply trying to let him know we'd be a large party, so he could possibly seat others accordingly to be able to accommodate a large party (since restaurants have a limited number of tables they can push together.) I was appalled by Lyle's tone, and unwillingness to even listen.  My thought was....do I really want to patron a restaurant where the management is rude and has no customer service skills??  I then called the Mallard Creek location and spoke to their manager Robert.  My entire office goes there for lunch together frequently and Mallard Creek always accommodates us.  Robert was courteous and professional.  He said he would be happy to work with us.  I thanked Robert for his professionalism and told him how rude Lyle was to me. Upon arrival, our table was ready, our server was personable and awesome!

The restaurant provides a more upscale feel without the price tag. The food is fantastic and the service OMG it can not be matched. We are very picky about our thai food. Believe me no other thai restaurant in town touches this place."

He got the number 20 with seafood. About an hour later he spent the entire night throwing up and having diarrhea. I called first thing in the morning to warn them and the manager was EXTREMELY rude. Didn't care and kept saying 'well what can I do about it' I told him he probably should not sell that batch of soup and at least refund that meal. He would not do anything and said there is no way of knowing it was from his food. So disappointed, what awful service."

It was very neat and tidy, nicely decorated, and comfortable.  It is a place you can actually enjoy a good meal and hold a conversation you can hear for change.  The food was fantastic (try the stuffed boneless chicken wings... you will be as stuffed and happy as they are, just delicious).  The green curry was equally as good.  The staff and owners are so nice to talk with too.  We will definitely be coming back!"

I got lucky, I needed a table for two, and the hostess offered to seat us despite a full reservation list, and she she kindly asked if we would mind if we needed to be finished by 8:30 (we were seated around 7).  I personally appreciated that, instead of being turned away.   We both ordered the Cuban sandwich, and the food came very fast, waitresses were constantly checking in, refilling drinks, and we were satiated and finished by 7:45.  I'd prefer a lunch sandwich here more than paying the same for a jersey mikes sub, which are pretty good, but not as good as what they serve here."

Sometimes the server can be seen as rude, especially when they are busy. Thats just the way it is here. \n\nI personally think its a privilege to have sushi, ramen and other Japanese dishes of such quality available to me, so everything else is forgivable. \n\n90% of the time i have an awesome experience with the service at this restaurant.  100% of the time the food is great. \n\nIf you can set aside entitlement and just allow time for this place you will be in for a treat."

Most Indian restaurants serve dishes within a narrow range of flavors - a range that those of us who eat in the U.S. have grown accustomed and used to. It's familiar and perhaps a bit boring. Well, get ready for a new adventure if you go here. They have all the traditional dishes - but they come with a twist, a spice, a flavor, a sauce, that you likely haven't seen, smelled, or tasted before. I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which was scrumptious. I can't remember what my wife had to eat, because I obsessed and cherished over my own so. But I do remember that she was very impressed. I personally think this place is magisterial in their Indian cooking. If you don't know what that means, I'll just say the cuisine here rocks. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. Wish they were located in my hometown.  This one is an exception. You'll be in for a treat if you're in the mood for Indian food. We love this place & will continue to come back!!"

The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's. This place is beautiful but not worth the money, stress, or headache."

I ordered the blackened chicken tacos, my husband ordered the BBQ pulled pork dinner and my kids had a cheeseburger slider and cheese pizza and might I add the kids ate for free. And we also had a bucket of beer. I mean the atmosphere alone was amazing. Both managers were welcoming and gave us two different kinds of desserts for free since we were new to their restaurant, and the desserts (southern style bread pudding and double fudge brownie sundae) were literally to die for! And our waitress Ashleigh was amazing and attentive. Overall it was a fantastic experience. I would definitely recommend everyone I know and I would go there again myself."

We started the night with a few appetizers with the taste was not that good. \n\nBruschetta: a grilled baguette with sweet tomatoes, some garlic, oregano and evoo. I will say that this was the best appetizer on the table; the taste was just executed perfectly.\n\nCalamari: a flash and fried with some spicy marinara and caper aioli sauce, as a seafood lover I will say, I was a bit disappoint of the taste, I had better fried calamari in other restaurant this one was no that good. \n\nAsparagi: grilled asparagus a no a fan so cannot say too much about it. \n\nFor my main course I had a dilemma between the Filetto and the Mare, I ask the server for recommendation and he right away point me on to the Mare, he told that I was not going to regret choosing this disk. So I order it. \n\nMare is a mix of seafood with contents lobster, scallops, calamari, mussels, clams, shrimp and peperoncino with is over on linguini. I will say that this plate save this review and like the server told me did not regret ordering this plate. Everything was cook perfectly and there was plenty of seafood very fresh and with a great taste, the tomato sauce was light, tangy and perfect. Overall this was great disk. \n\nThe service was very good. The food did not take that long to show up. It wasn't a horrible experience, but it was not perfection. But like I say the Mare saved the day."

After squeezing into the most difficult 'business' spot EVER, I was greeted by a smug face notifying me they were closed, while standing behind a 'hours of operation' sign that clearly stated they were open for 55 additional minutes. \n\nKeep in mind, I visited this establishment's website prior to leaving the house to ensure they would be open so you can understand my frustration. \n\nObviously this business owner doesn't understand that the customer is the MOST important link in the successful business plan. \n\nI found my way to another Subway establishment in Gateway Plaza, that to my utmost surprise was open and able to serve me when their website stated they would be... What a way to do business! \n\nIf you're looking for a late evening sandwich, I would suggest finding your way to this Gateway Subway. If you're looking to damage your vehicle, and NOT have your late evening cravings satisfied, by all means head over to this non-operational franchise... You may want to call first though or make a reservation and by all means don't plan on toasting, that's probably been down since breakfast IF they're open. \n\nThis is NOT the subs you're looking for..."

Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

The food's good, especially for the price.\n\nI've had some inconsistencies, though - a prime rib that was really too rare and chewy, a couple of steaks that have been too well-done for the medium-rare I normally order. I wish there were more appetizing healthy options - the vegetables you can order on the side are heavily buttered and salted, and most of the best savory foods they have on offer are drowning in butter, but I suppose that's what you're going to get with this kind of restaurant. \n\nI always leave feeling full, and it always feels like I more or less got my money's worth - and the staff is really fantastic."

Went down there for my daughter's birthday to celebrate and seemed like that they were doing us a favor by been in there. So we cut down going there from once a week to stop going there and it's been months. Decided to give it one more try because we liked the food and this is the last time going there. Waiter was rude and quick with his responses, he didn't bring everything we ordered form the the start. We had to go hunt him down to get rest of our food and than acted like I was bothering him by asking. Than our drinks were empty for a minute be fore we had to hunt him down to get more drinks. When we ordered out food it was cold and looked like he served it to us from last night's leftovers. I know how hard the waiting staff work and I never have tipping less then 20%. But today is the first time I left a note for management letting them know how disappointed we were and left $0.00 tip.

We've celebrated birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's Day, etc there and now we even bring our 1 year old son there with us and he loves it there because the staff are so friendly and playful with him. The atmosphere, people and delicious food make this restaurant top in my books!"

Constantly running food to the wrong table and was very awkward. I do feel bad because it seems like he was just given the job without any training whatsoever. The trivia questions on trivia night were laughable. If you want to go somewhere that hosts Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader nights then this is your place. It would not have been so awful if our server was even around. We had 1 beer the whole night because our server was not present to even ask if we wanted another beer or refill on water. Food was mediocre at best. Good customer service can always make up for lackluster food but this was definitely not the case. Bad attitude among entire staff including management and all around disorganized. It's a shame because it's a great location."

But the staff here is so helpful that they will explain you everything in detail. They are also very nice with our kids. This was our fifth visit in 2 months after moving to Charlotte. Me my wife with my 2 daughters love it here. Will recommend it to everyone in our community. #TheBlueTaj"

Nothing seemed seasoned well at all. We will not be returning to this Qdoba. The one uptown is much better!"

We ordered several dishes to share and everything was much better that we all expected. The only 'complaint' was that it wasn't as spicy as we all were used to. They did ask us how spicy we wanted everything (we chose 3/5). I think we have a better understanding of their spicy-scale and will adjust accordingly for next time. We will definitely be back. Very reasonable prices for good food. Recommended."

He was then very, very rude upon our check out and instructed the cashier to 'handle the patrons behind us' while we were standing in front of her getting our bill straightened out, which never occured. $31.37 was paid for a fish meal with grits and eggs, and an egg plate with sasauge. I will absolutley never return. Very poir customer service."

I appreciated the expedient service, but the overcooked shrimp in my jumbo shrimp scampi were hard to overlook. Given my previous pleasant dining experiences at the diner, I was disappointed. The chocolate cake made up for the shrimp, though. I will be coming back, I have too much nostalgia tied to this place to let one bad dinner determine any future consumption of whatever else Landmark has to offer. Jeepers, this is comprehensively pretentious given that my only real complaint was some rubbery shrimp."

They are the equivalent of sitting in economy class on a commercial airliner except they are vinyl which makes them even more uncomfortable.  The old seat were wide and swiveled and rocked.  The old seats were an improvement on traditional theater seats.  The new ones are worse than traditional theater seats.

Loud profanity was used when coworkers engaged and they openly talked bad about customers that they didn't like for whatever reason. Our movie experience was great.

It turned out to be one the worst decisions that I made in my life. First of all, I was treated rudely by the front-desk man as well as a waitress who was standing there. Well, I admit that being somewhat socially anxious does cause me to appear nervous and strange in unfamiliar places, but I still felt insulted when the man and waitress laughed along with several Spanish-speaking dudes who were checking out before me, and who were clearly pointing, looking, and making fun of me... However, I wouldn't give the place 1-star just for that reason alone. On top of that, the food was so disgusting and tasted like they were cooked a week ago. I even found a hair in my eggplant, and ended up throwing away about half of the food. I will NEVER come there again. A good thing is that I don't even live anywhere remotely near this place."

This restaurant is busy practically every single night and is usually very loud (loud people and acoustics).  I will never forget one of the taller male bar tenders one time was extremely loud and obnoxious, going on and cussing for some stupid reason and was rude to customers.  I have no tolerance for bar tenders that are so full of themselves that they pretend they are exempt from excellent customer service.  Even with these bad experiences, the up scale restaurant is quite well decorated in a historic building and the food was great, during my visits anyway; probably the best in Mooresville.  It is worth a well planned visit sometime for a special event or just a hop on your bar run."

After all, it's located in a middle-of- the-woods shopping center that I didn't even know existed!\n\n(Before I review, I must tell you that my little group of pals are VERY chit-chatty, and we can't stop talking.)\n\nThe waitress kindly sat us, all 5 of us, even though the biggest table they had was sat only 4 people. This was probably the only bad thing.\n\nWe talked and talked and talked and the waitress came by every ten minutes to ask about our drink orders, which we finally placed. This was our fault, she was just doing her job.\n\nAnother hour goes by and we finally place our meal order, which included pizzas and different Italian dishes. The food came rather fast and, I can't speak for my friends, but my pizza was cooked perfectly, made-to-order. It was hot and fresh and gooey and oh-so-good.\n\nBy the time we finished our talking, we had realized that the restaurant had actually CLOSED DOWN around us, and we were there at least a half hour after closing. The staff never mentioned it though, which was super-nice and accommodating. I would've expected them to kick us out, which they didn't.\n\nSo overall, great food, friendly staff, and reasonable prices too- two pizzas were just $12 + tax and tip."

Warning though, if you plan to come on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared to wait up to an hour, possibly two, for a table inside. I will say though, it's more than worth the wait."

Here's the catch though, I never get anything else but the baby back ribs, with coleslaw and French fries. So to ask me about the rest of the menu is a complete waste of time. With that said, the ribs are the best. I can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all. Why? Well it's not because I'm a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite. 5'9, 150. It's because the ribs are so good that I am not even thinking about how full I am. The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is insane. And throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and I am happier than a pig in... Do yourself a favor and get the ribs!! On a side note, my wife last year ordered the catch of the day and she said it was good. Now she only gets the ribs. Nice servers and a nice looking, clean place too."

Five minutes later the manager comes over with the gumbo and says here's something to munch on while you wait for the wings (I wanted it to come out WITH the wings).  No real apology was offered just another long wait for wings....and the order was STILL wrong.  \n\nWe ordered charred wings in two different flavors.  Came out plain and flavorless.  Staff seemed to be irritated when it was brought to their attention.  Manager brought out two bowls of sauce that should have been cooked on the wings and said 'here try this'!!\n\nI'm not going to go into the fact of having to ask for extra napkins as well as tea refills.

I asked the server for extra crispy wings upon placing my order and the wings were white in some areas looking as if they were baked. Very soft and soggy. A basic franchise like Wing Stop has better wings and also Hickory Tavern with their old bay wings. Hopefully this can be fixed."

Chopped pork, brisket, and burnt ends were tender, cooked to near perfection, and DELICIOUS! Burnt ends are a must!! If you're going for those items, you're in for a treat. St Louis ribs were a bust (rarely do I ever say that on any review). \n\nMy brother ordered the Hot Mess burger. From his reaction, they should leave that off the menu. It was smothered in cheese to the point he thought it was a grilled cheese sandwich. My mother ordered the smoked salmon. Cooked really well but saltier than what she would have preferred. I concur. \n\nFinally, I ordered the Select 4 combo. My review on food is above. My quarrel is the portion size. For $34 I expected... More. Again, maybe I am hard on the portion cause I wanted more brisket, or cause I wanted to make a sandwich out of my chopped pork. Making my peace, food was still delicious as I've been saying. As a more informed patron, maybe I'll have a more satisfying experience next time."

My first time was before two days ago, a guy suggested the mole & cheese plate, I felt in love with that meal. Yesterday, I went there and asked the guy who works there for the launch menu, he told the launch time is over, and he is right, because I came at 5:45. Anyway, I asked him about the best meal for a starving man, he chose a great meal which made me glutted. They serve really good, and they are working hard too. Also, their prices are REASONABLE. Hopefully, I will be back here in the future."

The butter they put on it is great. I got mac and cheese and rice for the sides. Good. The fried mashed potato balls are amazing. I would recommend getting a house special, pot roast, chicken and dumplings. Took a little bit to get the food. Price is good."

The food is to die for!! Every time I eat here I'm impressed, and even bring visitors to charlotte here. I will always come here for a belly full of the best comfort food since grandma's. The service is efficient and knowledgeable, and very friendly."

        "Review": "Vegans and vegetarians: Do NOT eat here.\nMy boyfriend and I came here for the first time the other day after seeing that you advertise on the door that you offer vegan options inside (there's really only one or two). We had heard good reviews from our omnivore friends and decided to try. I am vegan, my boyfriend is vegetarian. I was assured that the veggie loaf is vegan so that is what I ordered. I got mashed cauliflower instead of mashed potatos and black beans as the second side. My boyfriend ordered the veggie burger with pimento cheese. About 15 minutes later, our waitress came and told me she made a mistake and the veggie loaf is not vegan, but I could get the veggie burger instead, so I did. We waited about an hour longer for our food to come out. When it finally did, I was brought the veggie burger and black beans. I asked about the mashed cauliflower I had ordered. She said that because I changed my order to the burger, it only came with one side. I told her I wish I had known that, I wanted the cauliflower. Our waitress then took the bowl of black beans right off my plate. I thought that was a little uncalled for. It was not my mistake, I should have been able to keep the beans, and I don't appreciate people reaching onto my plate. A few minutes later, she brought out the mashed cauliflower. My boyfriend was waiting patiently for me to get my food before he started on his, and when I finally got mine, we began eating. As soon as he bit into his burger, we discovered a huge mistake. He had been brought a real beef burger, not a veggie burger. We do not eat meat and have not in a very long time because we do not believe in the slaughter of animals for food. It has been 6 days and he still cannot stop thinking about the fact that he ate a cow. As soon as he realized it, he flagged our waitress down and showed her his burger. She was super apologetic and took his plate back to bring him the correct order with a veggie burger. She also brought him a free beer. The apology and the free beer were appreciated, but we were still made to pay for this meal, which we feel was just not right. We were extremely disappointed in our experience at Dish, which was a huge let-down after hearing good reviews. My poor boyfriend is also paranoid about everything we eat after this experience. \nI contacted Dish management after this experience and unfortunately they could not be bothered to respond to me. Terrible customer service."

They had a pot roast that was insanely good.  It was comfort food done better than any other place I'd ever been.\n\nHowever, as we returned to Dish time and again, it became clear that it had a problem: a lack of consistency in quality.\n\nSome days we'd go in and get a fantastic meal.  Other days we'd order the same things feel that they were okay at best.\n\nThis was all several years ago, so I don't know what the current state of affairs is there.  I'd recommend stopping by and making up your own mind, because when it's good, Dish is phenomenal."

Me and my wife have came here before and ate around the same thing or a little less but our check have never been that high before. We order 2 Leek dumping, 2 chicken feet, 2 shrimp ball, 2 har gow, and 1 Seafood Crispy Pan Fried Noodle. The total shouldn't have be $92 and they say 'TIP IS NOT INCLUDED'. THEY HAVE THE NERVE TO ASK US CAN WE TIP THEM 15% TIP. PRETTY MUCH THE TOTAL IS DOUBLE OF WHAT WE USUALLY PAY. WE WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN. IF YOU HAVE TO EAT AT THIS PLACE, CHECK YOUR TOTAL AND ADD UP YOUR MEAL AND SEE IF THEY ADD THE TIP OR NOT. I RECOMMEND NO ONE TO GO HERE. DRAGON COURT IS OUR NEW SPOT."

        "Review": "I have gone to Anntony's for the longest time. Since 1994. In 2000, I moved to another state and unfortunately the owner sold the restaurant as a franchise and moved to Sugarcreek. Since then, I would come back to Charlotte once a year to see family and visited the 7th street location. Unfortunately, I had noticed the quality of the food declining over the years. First it was they stop basting and marinating the chicken in Anntony's Sauce. Which is the whole point about Anntony's. Then they stop seasoning the chicken. But they still roasted the chicken and used the sauce, so I was still good.\n\nIt's 2016, and this place is now a disappointment. The only thing that is Anntony's is the sauce. The quality of the chicken has gone down. I have never been so disappointed when I saw my food. Anntony's was famous for its Anntony's All-Purpose Sauce and Chicken. The original staff would start slow roasting his chicken with a bucket of sauce and basing it at every turn. Creating chicken wings of sticky and saucy goodness. \n\nThis time, I ordered for takeout blindly expecting the same chicken I have eaten for years. Nope, this time, it seems there's either a new owner or manager. They closed off the bar area and now instead of slow-roasting the chicken, they deep fried it and let it sit in a hot bin till someone places an order. What a disappoint. The chicken doesn't even have a good color. It looks over fried and old. The chicken meat is dry and bland. No better than fried buffalo wings from an old bar.\n\nPlease do not go here and head to the Sugarcreek location instead. At least they still make the chicken by Anntony's standards. I haven't been there yet on this current trip to Charlotte. But I may just go tomorrow so that I can have a good experience with Anntony's wings before I leave."

Goose was fabulous to work with,  addressing all my needs and taking care of all the details.  The BBQ was amazing, tender and delicious with just the right amount of 'burn'!  The smoked bacon wrapped jalapeno peppers were to die for - a crowd favorite!  And all at a price that can't be beat - best valued BBQ by far!  I hope I have an opportunity one day for Goose to cater another event for me, my family or friends.  I'm definitely spreading the word! \nThanks, Goose!  You're the best!!"

I explain how long we already waited and she proceeds to argue with me and tell me I'm wrong! We spoke to the manager and she offered us a free appetizer on our next visit, so we decided to try again. We went back last night and I found THREE long beard hairs rolled into my sushi!

As soon as I entered Mamas I was happy with the layout and the music playing . Place was empty for a Friday evening. Just us and one other table. Took 15 min before someone came by with a menu.  A very friendly bartender eventually brought menus and took the order. Oxtail rice and peas, Mac n cheese and steamed cabbage for me. Stew chicken, rice and peas And candy yams for my lady.   The yams were straight from a can, the Mac n cheese was tasteless and chewy. My oxtail was decent. 7.5/10 and the rice about the same. Nicer looking restaurant than other West Indian spots in the area  but the food was not up to par.  I might return to hear the music and get a few drinks on a Saturday night but won't order food. I hope the owners read these reviews and make changes. We want to support our own, but put some love in the pot."

It tasted like the pesto was made in house for sure. For our pizzas we ordered the deli pie and the country pizza. The deli pie was bursting with flavor that worked together. The country pizza was my favorite of the 2. Despite only having 2 toppings 'country ham and carmelized garlic' the flavors were fabulous. We will definitely be returning and looking forward to trying additional craft pizzas prior to declaring the country one my absolute favorite!!!"

I was beginning to think there was no such thing in this town. They don't claim to be a NY pizza but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...anyway, the only way you would give this a low rating is if you happen to have a bad experience with the staff (not likely, they were all great, I'm especially looking at you Maddy)."

However, after standing up front for more than a few minutes, I was ignored by a waitress who busied herself with a check instead of greeting me. Then a second waitress who looked more interested in dropping some plates off at the kitchen than talking to me, gave me an odd look and asked if I needed something. I said I had an order for pickup and she said to go to the back bar. \n\nWhile I found the pizza delicious and the decorating cute, I felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome there. I would gladly eat their pizza again, but don't have any interest in going back to their establishment. Either a host, friendlier staff, or a simple sign would have completely changed this experience."

Its flavor less and sloppily put together. The lady tried to hurry and put the food in the bag for a reason. I'm sure the other 5 star reviews were written by family and friends. I can prepare better food watching YouTube tutorials. The food here is disgusting and expensive.

So then she comes back and tells us that the chicken wings will take up to 30 minutes also. By then we were over it. So we got up and just said never mind!

I placed an order for delivery and I asked for Parmesan, crushed red peppers, and marinara sauce to come with it. The delivery driver showed up with only blue cheese dressing, which I had also asked for. I asked him about the other condiments and he offered to pick them up and return to deliver them but I told him not to worry about it because I was hungry. I then went inside and called the restaurant just to bring to their attention that they failed at customer service this time. They offered to bring the condiments out again but I declined the offer. I was simply too hungry to wait but I wanted to bring it to someone's attention. I immediately thought of going online to do a bad review, but I thought 'No, I'll give them a second chance. They usually provide great customer service but they were just really busy and slipped this time.' Less than ten minutes later, and after my pizza was eaten, I heard a knock on my door. It was a different delivery guy there to bring me the condiments they left out. I was absolutely amazed!!! I could do nothing but smile and say 'thank you'. He apologized and went about his way. Even though I couldn't enjoy my pizza with the requested condiments like my taste buds wanted, they still came through like normal. I literally wanted to cry! (That's how serious I am about customer service!) I immediately came online to write this review and I definitely recommend Fuel Pizza to anyone, anytime! The pizza is the best in town and the service is outstanding! I actually want to work there and be a part if their team just for that alone, and I don't know anything about making a pizza. That's Fuel! You came\n through once again and I'm definitely a proud and loyal customer, forever! :)"

Granted, the outside seating is nice and if you like pingpong you're coming here to play, but the service is typically terrible and the food is nothing special. I often leave asking myself how the hell I just spent $40 on some Sysco nachos and a few pints of beer. The waitstaff doesn't really seem ready to do much of anything, and for a place that often seats groups of friends they chronically struggle with breaking up checks and getting everyone's orders in quickly. Take away the patio and this place probably shouldn't exist."

Since we were in the area, we stopped at Workman's for a libation.  We found a spot at the end of the bar, and the bartender, Chris, quickly attended to our service.\n\nWe chatted with him about how we ended up at Workman's, and by the time we left that evening, we had made a new Charlotte friend.  When we made the move to Charlotte a couple of months later, we stopped back at Workman's, and Chris immediately came over and welcomed us back.\n\nI highly recommend The Workman's Friend for a great atmosphere.  However, being not of the younger generation, I find that on weekend late nights the bar tends to shift from relaxing, inviting pub and eatery to full on night club.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's not for me."

As far as the salad I am not picky and a few browned greens would not bother me much except with this salad there was quite a few of the greens that were browned and most like used from the day prior.

The quality of the food ranges from pretty good to just flat out awful, when it used to be consistently awesome. Now they've started a new practice of leaving their phone off the hook for the last 30 minutes that their open so people can't call in pickup orders. I tried to call in a order for pickup at 8:30 (They close at 9) two weeks ago because I live literally 2 minutes from the place and got nothing but busy signals for 5 minutes straight. I drove up there to order the to-go order in person and while I was waiting in line behind another person who walked in right before me I decided to try to call and see if the phone would ring since the person working the register was clearly just hanging out and not doing a thing (It's now 8:40). Sure enough the line was still busy and not a single person in that restaurant was on the phone taking an order. Since then I've tried several other times to call at the same time with the same results. Nothing but busy signals until the close. What an awful way to run a business that has so much potential."

When I first came to this spot when it opened I was blown away at the quality and selection. Now I get a caprese salad with a sargento sandwhich slice of mozzarella cheese. Terrible."

The food was ok, but they were out of most of their beer selection, and don't keep the list currently (I had to wait after ordering four different beers to find out it wasn't in stock and then resubmit an order with our waiter). The wait staff was also unknowledgeable about their menu (what type of beer or ingredients). The roof top is a cool concept but poorly executed for where the sun sets.  You can smell the wait staff smoking weed on the second floor roof while sitting up there and receiving poor service. I'll be surprised if this place makes it another year in the black, and will likely be gone soon."

When I arrived today, there was no line and I placed my order right away. The employees did not move with any sense of urgency and spent about twenty minutes preparing my sandwich. The time wouldn't bother me if the employees were making involved sandwiches, or if there were other orders in the queue before mine.  What frustrated me most was what supposed to be a warm toasted sandwich, was room temperature by the time I paid. This is not the first or the second time I have been disappointed by Bodega.

Instead of calling and informing me before taking it upon himself to choose for me. 3 when he FINALLY got to me he basically tried to demand a tip (remind you I already had tip in cash in my pocket) without giving me a chance to reach inmy pocket. Instead he stated that if the customer doesn't tip on card they look forward to tip in cash since they deliver on a bike. Then he went to say 'So we can't deliver to you any longer if you can't tip'.  Then walked off. 4 usually when you pay with card you have to sign a credit card copy saying you received your Delivery and so forth but he was so rude he forgot to give me my copy or have me sign. With that being said I called the business to speak with the manager to inform him about this bad service and the man in the phone said the manager/store owner wasn't in at the moment and he couldn't do anything to help but ta!e my name and number so I am waiting for this call because this was my 1st and LAST time spending my hard earned coins with this business and I still haven't touched the food and I will not dare. If the manager can't understand my concern and take action then I will take matters into my own hands (Legally) and make sure that this is never done to anyone that decides to spend their money with them EVER AGAIN!!!! I HAVE WORKED IN FOODS AND NUTRTION SERVICES AND THE HOSPITAL FOR OVER A YEAR AND WAITRESSED BEFORE FOR OVER 3YEARS. With that being said I have spent over 8years of my life in customer service and I know how you suppose to treat customers and I know that as a employee you are representing the company and it starts with customer service. Point.Blank.Period.\nI will update my review after I get a call from the manager if they really handle customer complaints the right way. We shall see.\n\nR.Tyson"

We got complimentary chips and salsa, and waited about 20-30 mins for our food. I ordered the mahi mahi and shrimp corn tacos which were very flavorful. Another friend ordered (in Spanish) a chicken burrito without rice, but what she received had plenty of rice. She ended up ordering another one without rice and taking the wrong one to go. They also forgot to put beans on the side, but corrected it when she pointed it out. The other friend ordered a quesadilla and she enjoyed it. Some other things were off as well when it came to getting that burrito order right, but the craziness really happened when the bill came. For some reason, and the two women were never able to explain, the 'tax' there was 15%. Now, we did use a coupon, so maybe this was their way of recouping the lost revenue, but in the end, they didn't get a tip and got exactly what was due for what we'd bought. They also only wanted cash, but I pointed out to them that they'd only put up the sign AFTER we sat down, but my friend went to withdraw money for them. The food was good, but the dishonesty is grounds for being reported to the BBB."

The GM came to our table and proceeded in speaking to us like we could not afford the meal. He spoke rudely to my wife out of the gate, and ultimately said he 'did not want our future business'.\n\nNowhere in the world of professionalism should that statement come out of the mouth of one running a restaurant.\n\nSo, if you're willing to roll the service dice to get a high priced small portion meal - which we were - and credit to the chef it was good - then maybe this place is for you, but we will never be back."

I finally went to Yama Izakaya yesterday because I had heard they had 'authentic ramen.' I've been disappointed by many other restaurants who make the claim, but have terrible ramen. Authentic tonkotsu ramen is one of the best foods I've ever eaten. It's the Japanese comfort food equivalent of the cheeseburger to an American. I'd recommend anyone to try it. \n\nBack to Yama's tonkotsu (pork) ramen. Overall, I'd give it an 80-85 grade, relative to ramen you would get in Tokyo, or a city with a large Japanese population like LA or Seattle. It was solid ramen, although it didn't blow me away in the same way that it did in Japan. The flavor was there, the ingredients were all there, and were all done well. I'd personally prefer the broth to be creamier though. But different places make it differently. I even experienced this in Japan... that each restaurant made it a little different, sometimes more watery, sometimes thicker. I'll probably go back to have it again sometime. I'm glad somewhere in Charlotte actually does it reasonably well. \n\nMy only major drawback on it is that it's pretty dang expensive. I remember going to LA to have ramen, or even in Tokyo, and the price was around $8-10 tops. I think it was about $13 for the ramen without adding anything in addition (although it comes how you would expect it, but you can add more pork, etc). If the ramen was $8, I'd probably go there every day to have it. At $13, maybe once every couple weeks.\n\nThe restaurant itself was a cool place. Make sure you have a pint of Asahi beer with your Tonkotsu ramen. That's the only way to take it!"

Mussels were bland and barely warm and I think undercooked because they were slimy.  The beef on the sliders was chewy and gray.  Next, dinner.  It was warm, but very bland.  The halibut was dry and there was a tiny bit of slimy crab meat on top.  The lamb was chewy, but the mashed potatoes were good.  Not going back.  Disappointing."

We were a few minutes early but were seated immediately. \n\nI had the Blackened Heart of Ribeye topped with herb blue cheese butter. On the side were fingerling potatoes (cooked in duck fat) and asparagus. It was out of this world, and the potatoes were off the chain!\n\nMy wife had Just for the Halibut. The Halibut was topped with lump crab and was placed over roasted red peppers, spinach, and a chive potato cake amongst a sun dried tomato beurre blanc.\n\nShe loved it, although her spinach was a bit sandy. \n\nWe didn't have room for desert, but there was no way we could skip the cheesecake.  Also off the chain! I am typically a fan of dense cheesecake... this is not, but the flavor was amazing."

The waitress seemed like she had never waited tables before. We were brought water after a table that sat down after us did. The waitress told us the specials, but when we went to order, found out that 1/3 of the menu was not available because they were out. She did not offer substitutions or other options, which we heard her give other guests. The food was barely average, and the grits notably came out barely warm. The ham was over salted, and my fiance's omelet special with 'ham' had no ham in it. We will be moving to this area soon, and will likely not return to The Liberty."

I felt because i am not a regular they just sort of ignored me. I ordered  my burger med rare.  At first glance my toppings where piled high as i started arranging my burger the way i like it i noticed that the onions still had peels on them the pickles had no crunch they tasted old and water logged same with the tomatoes. I just moved them aside and started to eat my burger. After the first bite i could tell  it wasnt even close to med rare or even medium infact it was damn near well done. All i am saying is if you are going to charge me 10 dollars for a burger atleast cook it to the temp i want or dont ask me how i want it. All and all disappointed the only reason why they are getting 2 stars is because the beer was cold and the saut\u00e9ed spinach was good"

Great food, decent wine selection for a local bar and the best staff on East Blvd. My regular eats here are the excellent chicken wings (try the Gold Rush sauce), the beef on 'weck (I haven't eaten this anywhere else so have nothing to compare it to, but it's excellent), the fish and chips (crispy batter, flaky haddock, fantastic). Can't decide?...get the fish and chips and beef on 'weck combo every Sunday. Great patio right on East, where you can relax with a cold drink and watch the world go by.

Now let me personally review \u201cPike\u2019s Soda Shop\u201d for you... \n\nMost of the people writing that this place is 'an authentic soda shop' or 'retro' haven't lived through the 1940's or 50's to know what a REAL soda shop looks like; that is: Checkered marble floors, plush pink and turquoise booths and chrome interiors. Pikes is none of that...It's a brick building and once inside it feels no different than a modern sports bar. So in that regard, haven driven thirty minutes to get there, we were disappointed. \n\nIn terms of the food I ordered what was labeled \u201cMeatloaf\u201d on the menu and ended up getting something that was nothing more than a glorified salisbury steak with brown gravy poured all over the top. I added a side of Mac and Cheese and didn\u2019t care for that either, as there were bread crumbs baked in. My father order a club sandwich less bread and they brought him a bed of lettuce with Kraft singles cheese slices torn the length of the salad. You of thought they\u2019d just prepared the club sandwich the same way they normally would and used sandwich picks to hold the meal into place. He said the lettuce was dry and the meal was \u201cjust fair\u201d. \n\nWhen dinner was over I handed my credit card over to the waitress and she then told me that their internet was down and that I\u2019d have to wait awhile for them to ring me up; a couple of other families who were there were in the same predicament and none of us could cash out. While we were waiting the manager came over and asked if he could clear some of the plates out of our way, I said sure and then I asked him what was going on with their internet that we were wanting to settle up and leave. He looks at me right in the face two feet away and says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I said we\u2019ve been trying to settle up and can\u2019t because you can\u2019t process cards. This MOMO just kept staring at me until we basically got up and I told him to BLANK the hell off. What a dumbBLANK\u2026Anyways after twenty plus minutes we finally were able to settle up and leave. \n\nThe service, as far as drink refills and delivering meals, was at the 5 to 10% tip level and no more. \n (1 out of 5 Stars)"

I cannot for the life of me believe people post on here about aTHEIR IDIOT MOVE in making an ill advised parking decision to park on the Coops lot without permission and acting surprised that they got busted. Google Entitled and Hubris, weirdo... Also...the chicken is NOT cold and it is also not missing 'somethin'. I can guess what these folks look like and I bet they don't look like crazy chicken eating freaks which I.am. ALso...it IS cash only so what? 2/3 of those rat infested dives in New Orleans are cash only too. So.what? It is their policy. You don't like it, go get ptomaine poisoning at a Petro Express. They'll take your AmEx Black card, Lord Farnsworth III. And you aren't fooling anybody. Your auntie, mama, husband's chicken is no way any better than this. I swear."

I ordered the blackened chicken tacos, my husband ordered the BBQ pulled pork dinner and my kids had a cheeseburger slider and cheese pizza and might I add the kids ate for free. And we also had a bucket of beer. I mean the atmosphere alone was amazing. Both managers were welcoming and gave us two different kinds of desserts for free since we were new to their restaurant, and the desserts (southern style bread pudding and double fudge brownie sundae) were literally to die for! And our waitress Ashleigh was amazing and attentive. Overall it was a fantastic experience. I would definitely recommend everyone I know and I would go there again myself."

The hostess was very polite.  She told us there would be a 30 minute wait but we were welcome to order our drinks from the bar ahead of time.  Once we were seated, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  The server brought our drinks back pretty quickly.  Another server brought our food out, refilled our drinks, and got us silverware.  Our original server passed by when we were almost done eating.  He asked how we were doing but never stopped and obviously didn't hear us ask for refills and our check.  We had to ask another server for our check.  She asked who our server was; we did not know his name but did point him out to her.  When she saw who it was her facial expression changed and she said 'oh' .  I don't think I was the first person to have problems with him.  He did bring us our check and 3 to go drinks.  I left a $10 cash tip and wrote $0 on the bill.  The transaction processed through my bank today.  The boy who didn't have time to wait on us added $9 to my bill for a total of a $19 tip which he did NOT deserve.  I tip based on my service.  I would never leave no tip even with horrible service.  I am very disappointed.  I know $9 is not a lot of money to some but again I did NOT authorize the additional amount to be added to my bill."

        "Review": "Astonishingly Mediocre\t\n\nAlas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants\u2014unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.\n\nWhile I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn\u2019t busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive\u2014and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.\n\nThe waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff\u2014true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.\n\nDespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don\u2019t know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.\n\nMy entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.\n\nThe two word review:  Why Bother?"

Simply put, she needs more training.  We were never offered complimentary bread, and we didn't realize it existed until we were about to leave.  It was a slap in the face.  All of the other guest surrounding our table were complimented with the home-made treat.  My husband was never offered a refill of WATER.  When I ordered my side salad, she was quick to announce the additional cost of three dollars and some change.  Our server dropped the wine list off on the table, but never even mentioned it to us - I had to ask her if that was the drink menu.  We were never offered dessert, and it just goes on.  She has to be retrained or find a new profession.  \nOn the other hand, I will return in the future; the food was very good.  The italian & vinagarette dressing was outstanding.  My picky eater husband enjoyed the penne a la vodka with chicken.  The dessert that I glanced at while departing looked delicious.  The manager took care of us, and apologized. \nI realize that the server does not reflect their brand.  Mama's is a local favorite,  and their food is a testament to their popularity.\nI would like to try the pizza in the future :-)"

I didn't even eat the egg that was in it, as it was the most questionable looking egg I've ever seen. I also ordered the 'fresh spring rolls,' which were not even edible... tried to make them work with the peanut sauce that they came with, but that tasted like... hmm let me think... perfume, yep perfume. They didn't have their sanitation grade posted anywhere which made me suspicious, and lastly, their prices aren't updated online (no biggie), but I paid $3 more for the Pud/Pad See Ew and a $1 more for the rolls, than what was posted online.

Need to hire nicer friendlier people to serve customers fire everyone that was there in the front on 11/21/2015 at 7:45pm."

(Every Wednesday before my husband's hockey game, and then whenever else we don't feel like cooking) good service, but even better food. It's a small restaurant, but it's definitely worth it. Check it out if you haven't yet. THAI CRISPY CHICKEN & BROCCOLI IS AMAZING (#1 ON MENU)"

I would recommend this club as being the most fun in the area, but still lacking in the quality of women compared to other cities"

He comes back and says they don't have any rotisserie chicken and it would be at least 40 minutes. I asked why he didn't tell us that before. He stated the kitchen just told him. I asked if I could come back and he stated yes we have not used your group on. As I was leaving the waiter and other employees found it funny and were laughing. Needless to say I don't play with my food and do not feel comfortable going back there to eat. I'll just wait until the Groupon expires and returns back to my groupon account. It seems to be a common pattern there after reading the reviews."

I can't believe I paid almost $50 for my meal and they basically have me two shot glasses of brunswick stews, and two shot glasses worth of sides.

THE Management was made aware and actually told me he was interviewing applicants and he would get to me in fifteen minutes. Yet, my salad was made totally wrong. The General Manager was made aware and no action was taken. THE Chick Filet at CONCORD Mall represents what Chick Filet is all about. CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The Chick Filet South BLVD has no genuine customer service and should lose their status.  Customer SERVICE costs nothing. But, when you outright deny a patron this service you lose the value of great reviews and future customers.       \n\nNeeds a lessen in how CUSTOMER SERVICE is required. Without customers you have no Chick Filet. \n\nWaiting in line while a cashier talked about a customer's hair and where she can get it done while holding up the line SAD!!! Then management, poor management sad. They run the store like a ghetto Walmart. No comparison to Chick Filet CONCORD and that's the truth.  I compare their behavior to the behavior of a company who don't care about customer satisfaction. When you have management who don't care  and in response will not respond only, because they either don't care or they feel we have enough customers so no worries this is bad. I remember when I went to the Concord location. The employees and management WOW!! I felt like I was in a FIVE STAR Restaurant.   Places like these and managers like these need to know that the customer requires customer service not his or her personal views."

I agree to pay $8.75, but only because I'm addicted. \n\nUnfortunately, I think I'm giving up... Picante on Moorehead is a better burrito choice, since Phat Burrito isn't as reliable as it used to be, and the owner is always around going out of his way to make sure you have awesome service."

When it came, the sushi were very small pieces and grossly overpriced. \n\nOn their dinner menu the had no sushi platter so all had to be ordered by he piece. I've never been to a place that didn't have a platter which usually comes with soup and salad.. The manager told me they would make me a platter but just charged me by the piece anyway. No soup or salad included.\n\nIn the end I strongly suggest if you want good sushi to not go to Pisces. By the way, like most places in the Charlotte area it was very noisy.

Probably one of the best burgers that I ate in Charlotte ever. The restaurant is great, they have a ton of TV's covering almost every sport from Hockey, Basketball, Baseball (and Football when it's Sunday) and covering every angle you look at. When we ate here, the heat game was playing in the background while we ate so it wasn't that boring. Atmosphere is great for lunch or dinner.\n\nSadly, when we got there our first server forgot my Sprite while he got the rest of our drinks. But then once our second server came, she brought it to me when she looked at the table.\n\nIt's like a Duffy's (a sports bar in Florida) but in Charlotte."

Also, don't try to order a bbq plate with only 1 side.  They have no idea how to charge for that, even after you repeatedly offer to pay full price.  On the up side, they were friendly about it and the line moved quickly otherwise.  Plus, the hush puppies and sweet tea were good."

We loved Fiamma and plenty of food options for the gluten-intolerant (me).   After we shared the Delizia del Contadina salad I enjoyed the super-tender and flavorful osso bucco,  and Ron loved the gnocchi. One of his favorite pastas but many restaurants disappoint; not so at Fiamma.  Service was a little slow initially but then was very good. The wine list was fine for these two picky vino-heads and, although we did not try it, the dessert choices looked lovely.  We do not live in Fiamma's neighborhood, we're in Waxhaw, but it's worth the drive and look forward to coming back when possible."

First the girl who made my veggie borrito wasted meat sauce on my borrito from making someone else's while I'm just standing waiting for the next person to help me finish my borrito (they were all standing around).  Then the guy comes to do the rest and I ask him to make me another because I don't eat meat (god forbid had I been allergic).  So he asked the girl to make another one... She does and barely puts any beans on there this time... I decided not to make a scenen about it even though I was pissed.  Then the guy goes and wraps my borrito so that one side only has rice and beans and the toppings are all on the other side which I just discovered after getting home and taking a bite.  So after he finishes I'm still standing there at the register waiting as two other girls stand around the sink talking.  Wtf!?  Really is this how its done now chipotle... Shame how lazy unqualified and incompetent employees can really take a company down.  Chipotle is my favorite restaurant to go to and had I gone to this one first I'd never go back... I'm tempted to drive the 20min back and hand them my half eaten borrito and demand a refund.  I'm disgusted!"

Our waitress gave off the same feel, as she did not say anything when she came to our table. She poured our waters and said nothing until I asked about the buffet (since we had never been before). She answered politely, but also informed us that they closed at 3pm.  This made us feel extremely unwelcome, almost as if we were bothering the staff by being there. Not to mention, the buffet was out of food and showed no signs of being replenished before close. We ended up leaving before the waitress returned for our order.

The wings were raw in the middle and we told the waitress and she looked at us like OMG, she took both plates and did not apologize about 30 minutes later she brought the wings back out. There were OK after they cooked them. Then the dinner came out, she brought out 3 plates and went back to get the other one. When she sat my plate down before I started to eat I looked down and there was a long blondish brown hair on the plate. I told the waitress when she brought the last plate out and she took the plate and said twice are you sure this is not your hair. I said you just sat it down, my hair is black and curly does it look like my hair. The manager brought the new dinner out and he apologized and I explained that I realize accidents to happen, I told what I did not like was her asking me was I sure it was not my hair and she said it twice. The manager got very upset she said that he must have something to her because she was rude the rest of the night. We will be going back...."

I also had an egg roll,  not good, they were store bought and the mustard came  in a packet instead of homemade. I also ordered spicy chicken and vegetables with white rice. This was pretty good, i would order it again. The vegetables were fresh and abundant along with a generous amount of white meat chicken. They sell sweet tea, which i returned because it was to sweet. The menu says they have hot green tea but the waiter said they did not have hot tea. The walls and doors are filthy and in need of a paint job. So while i was sitting there their delivery driver walks in wearing a old Tshirt and his shorts half way down his butt, then walks into the kitchen. Grose! There is no way i would eat food that their delivery driver touched. After getting lost on his delivery, i overheard the phone call, he comes back to the restaurant,  plops himself down in a booth and cranks up some movie on his phone so loud I could hear the guns blazing and the body count being racked up across the restaurant. Man if I was in charge that guy would be washing tabels and chairs and painting walls instead of sitting there making this Chinese restaurant in a strip mall look even less average then it is, pluss he would be wearing a belt."

One of the ladies behind the counter was incredibly rude and passive aggressive to my friends recently, I believe it was the owner's wife, and I felt so uncomfortable. I was really disappointed and shocked. Coming from a food industry background I have dealt with many difficult customers. One of the most important things in this business is to make your customers feel comfortable and taken care of even when they are not being pleasant. In our case no one was being unpleasant so I am not sure I understand what prompted this behavior. Sadly I will not be going back and I would not recommend this location."

General Tso's, Sesame chicken, crab rangoons, eggrolls, fried rice are all very good and taste classic. The pork fried rice is BANGIN!\n\nThe clerk is very stingy with soy sauce. Even when you ask for more, you might not get what you ask for. When you pick up your food make sure to open the bag and check for any extras such as spicy pepper oil as we didn't get ours this time.\n\nTL;DR\nFood is great except for the 'Chow Mein' which is not chow mein at all.

The order was placed wrong. I get it, it's late on a Sunday afternoon and they clearly did not want to be there but that is not my fault. If you don't like your job, find a new one. At no point were we rude or nasty so we did not deserve the treatment they gave us. They messed up the order. When we corrected them the got even more rude and snatch the bag of food out of my husband's hand. Then they said we didn't order 2 nuggets. When we tried to find the receipt we found they hadnt given us one that was itemized, only one that had the total. They refused to give us the bag back with the good we paid for until we paid them $1.07 for nuggets that we had ordered. The staff behind the lady in the window were laughing and making jokes about us. And they want to raise minimum raise. Well this staff wasn't worth a penny and should be fired. There is no excuse for how they acted. Why is it that I can go to a chick fila anywhere, and always get the same polite respectful behavior, maybe because they actually hire quality people. Not trashy people. I'm currently awaiting a call of an area supervisor. I'm not holding my breath though because if this person is responsible for the hiring we know what they will be like."

I'm not an alien, I'm a hungry charlottean who expects, and deserves,  at least half decent service. You people are demanding $15 an hour?? Show you're worth half that by taking care of your customers and taking some, however small it may be, pride in your work. Will not be back. Which is fine for you.

At one point, a server actually tried to remove a plate with food on it and I had to grab the piece of bread off before he took it away. When we asked to speak to the manager to give feedback (we didn't want others to feel as rushed as we did), the general manager did not come over until our waitress asked him for a third time and actually walked him over to the table. He was condescending and smirking through the encounter and offered little apology for the poor service. It was his lack of interest in my experience that will prevent me from recommending this restaurant and I will not be dining there again. Customer service is everything. I've worked as an office assistant before so I know how it is to be talked down to, but I expect my genuine feedback to be taken seriously."

It tasted more like steak  than seafood.\n\nDecor was interesting, but felt very homey. The server was nice and recommended we stay away from the lamb gyro (we didn't try it, but if the server doesn't recommend it, I wouldn't either.)\n\nI would give it 5-stars except that the noise level was obnoxiously loud. I went with 3 friends and we were practically yelling the entire time, even though it was 8:30pm on a Thursday. The acoustics were horrible; it's one large room with no noise dampening. \n\nI would definitely go back for the food, but I would only sit outside, because I can't stand to yell while trying to enjoy a meal."

I essentially paid $15+ for a small piece of chicken. Fried green tomatoes are good but 4 slices (not even 1 tomato) over grits for $10 is too much. The service is also hit or miss. It\u2019s a nice chill spot, they just need to work on training their servers and adjusting either the price or the portion. If you want to go, small plates are appropriately priced at half price during happy hour."

Chicken wings are okay. Pimento cheese was okay. Brussel sprouts where excellent. Nothing to bring us back a second time. The pineapple drink has a beautiful presentation, but not enough to share for two, definitely overpriced.

        "Review": "Came here with a party of 4 on July 4th. The waitress told me asking for a hamburger 'well done' would create a '60 minute ticket for her'. Thinking that was an odd comment, but not wanting to inconvenience the people I was dining with, I picked something else off the menu: a BBQ chicken plate. As soon as I said it, the waitress GROANED and said that the BBQ chicken 'would take too long'. WOW.  Again, not wanting to inconvenience the guests I was dining with, and getting angry and very embarrassed at this point, I ordered a simple HOUSE SALAD. The waitress seemed confused and asked what I wanted in the salad. After the food that THE WAITESS allowed us to order arrived, she never checked on us again, never brought Splenda for our unsweetened tea (it was missing from the table) and gave my partner a hard time when she couldn't see the tiny salt shaker buried in the condiment box. The WAITRESS snapped 'well it was in there this morning'. You should be fully staffed and able to accommodate any basic item ordered off the menu, especially on a holiday that you are choosing to be open for. I will NEVER eat here again and I will be sure to tell everyone about my experience. The food is way over rated and the waitstaff is rude."

Great scenery and the Dj was stellar. When we sat down we ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Melon passion cocktail. The Cabernet was horrid and the Melon cocktail came in a wine glass and tasted like a water down popsicle. We then proceeded to order two teriyaki dinners one with chicken and one with chicken and shrimp. It took about 45 mins before our food arrived and astonishingly the food tasted horrid. The rice was undercooked and tasted like they froze it from the night before and cooked it the next day with lots of oil in the pan. The chicken was very suspect it had a teriyaki drizzled that tasted like death and the chicken seemed as if it wasn't real. The shrimp was just plain terrible and unseasoned. We mentioned to the waitress we weren't satisfied with the food and she just stared at us like a deer in headlights so we just decided to pay and write a review. \n\nWe may go there again just for the atmosphere and drinks but we will not return for the food. \n\nMaybe we will have to try the sushi :)"

They are cut and cooked fresh in house, just like Five Guys. But these are slightly thinner than Five Guys, so they are a little more crispy. So tasty! And then you get to the subs. The bread, amount of meat, freshness of the toppings, and overall flavor cannot be beat by anyone. I 100% stand behind my claim that Penn Station has the best subs in town. I usually eat here every other week or so, and I'm always looking forward to the next time. This particular location has nice employees and is pretty clean.

Overall, the food was good (I definitely recommend the Peruvian ceviche!) with artful presentation; but nothing else really stood out as a show-stopper. Portions were small (which I prefer - get to taste more without over-induldging). Our server Javis was very friendly and attentive; however, the manager seemed cold from the moment she seated us to when she came out to address one of our questions/concerns.

        "Review": "Good Evening, I am writing in reference to an incident with one of your employees on Thursday June 28th, 2016 before leaving at  4:45pm. At 3039 Suite A South Blvd. A Hispanic male employee about 5'11 or 6 feet with facial hair and a beard with chestnut colored skin took my order.  The first thing I had asked the employee that represented this Subway store was if I could get a foot long with two different types of bread. His reply was yes. We proceeded to the next step which was building my sandwich. Upon my request of  condiments I asked if he could drizzle it across zig-zag. He squeezed a glob of it on one side of my bread. I simply excused him for making this error. After the last step of him making my sandwich he turns it over to the young black male. The young black male was in the process of  checking me out when he noticed I had a Subway Offer. The Hispanic male comes over and says you have to present this before ordering. I said okay and explained to him this was the first time me hearing this at a Subway. I had no problems, but I wanted to let him know that this Subway operated differently from the rest. The Subway offer was ANY foot long for $ 6.00. The Hispanic male told me that he was going to charge me extra for using two different pieces of bread. I had asked him before we even started to build my sandwich if I could use two different types. He did not tell me that it would be extra for the bread his only response was yes you can use two different types of bread. If I knew that then I wouldn't have ordered that. He rung up something on the cash register and my total came out to be $ 15 dollars and some change. I explained to him sir I am trying to use my coupon offer can you make my sandwich over again if it's going to be this much. He refused to make it over and said that I had to buy it at $ 15 dollars and that the sandwich will be thrown away was his excuse/reason. I have been going to Subway for the past 2 years and I have gone enough to know how Subway operates. I am displeased in the service of that franchise business. I shouldn't have to pay that much for a foot long sandwich without adding any extras to it. I walked thirty minutes to a Subway that treats their customers like trash. Not only that he was on his phone in the back when it was starting to get busy. Customers come before anything. I will not be going to that Subway again and not any other Subway's. He wanted me to leave the store and that was his way of doing it. It sad when you have a lazy unfriendly employee who is representing Subway in a negative way no matter what position they hold at a Subway store."

You'll want to bring cash for tipping or tell them to add it to your bill if paying with a card.  Skip the franchises and safe bets for once.  Support a small family business and eat at the Philly."

The wait staff here are so thoughtful and really take the time to add the little touches to make it a great dining experience. The food was absolutely to die for. Their mac and cheese and rib eye were absolutely phenomenal. The deserts are also some of the best I've had in the area. We will definitely be back!"

Great place to bring a group of friends and try a bunch of different things.\n\nFocus on fresh, locally sourced, and creative tapas options.\n\nCamarones tacos really good, as was the Black-Eyed Pea Hummis.  The latter was gluten free too.\n\nParking, as it ALWAYS has been since the place was Blue Fin is horrendous.  Spend two bucks and valet."

Our groups meals never came out, drinks took 30+ minutes, missing appetizers, servers that acknowledged they forgot about us, and all around, a disappointment. Not worth the hype. Do yourself a favor and stick to Cantina. If you do go, get the guac, but not the cheese dip \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc"

The dining area was only half full at such an early hour. The waitress gave us the specials and then left us for 10 minutes.  She came back to take the order and when my boyfriend ordered the special, she said 'oh sorry, we just sold out of it' but the substitute is the same price for a much lesser option.  Okay fine, so he orders the chicken.  I kid you not, they brought out a chicken leg and a piece of bread!  For $27.  I have no problem paying top dollar for fine food, but charge me too dollar to leave a restaurant still hungry is absolutely insulting."

The house margarita is one of the best you'll have, get the 'super' version of it with the patron. The tableside quac is a must have if you come!! The sundried tomatoes they add really set it apart. Just keep in mind this is a higher end tapas restauraunt. This is not a place to come if you are looking for huge dishes. Instead, expect great quality dishes with locally sourced ingredients."

The seafood salad was fabulous.  They aren't really set up for what we wanted but worked hard to make our picnic a good time.  We'll be back and tell our friends to go. Thanks for the great,service"

Salsa bar is a great addition (it went away for a while but it's back now... It better stay!). Only reason it isn't 5 stars is because of how busy it gets at night. Hour waits and slow service, but we expect it. We just try to go before 4pm and don't really have many issues."

I don't work uptown anymore, so when I heard another outpost was opening on Kings Drive, I was ecstatic. We tried Uncle Maddio's on Kings Drive two times for takeout. The second time, they forgot my salad dressing but my husband didn't realize until he got home. He went back to get it, and Alberto, the manager (owner?), was so apologetic - he gave us a very generous gift card to make up for it. Just for forgetting my salad dressing! This is exactly the type of service I received at Uncle Maddio's in Overstreet mall, and it makes such a difference. I don't post reviews often (hardly at all), but I felt compelled to share this story. Alberto - you and your staff are awesome. Thank you for taking such good care of your customers. I actually don't love chain restaurants or fast casual in general, but you can bet my husband and I will be regulars at Uncle Maddio's on Kings!"

The entrance/exit door is in the middle of the diningroom and as many patrons left, they held the door open and let any cool air out.  As I was eating, I noticed several gnats/fruit flies flying around which wasn't very appetizing.  I used the restroom before I left and there were TOO MANY gnats/fruit flies in there.  I won't be back."

I like the normal cheese pizza, and oddly enough they had that on the menu.\n\nThe pizza was made in probably like 1 minute and 30 seconds from start to finish. The pizza tasted great and I would eat at Blaze Pizza if I ever need a quick lunch, but the whole 'normal' pizza is still a little bit better because it has more cheese once you bite down."

Since I work in customer service too, I always notice and appreciate a 5-star experience! Have you ever went to get lunch and you were served by someone who OBVIOUSLY really really really hates their job? It's a little disheartening, isn't it? Well not here. Every employee is smiling and having fun. They all seem to CARE about their job. They also use your name at every point of the pizza making process. This is not something you see at similar places like Chipotle or Moe's etc. These guys obviously have a great manager who encourages their awesome attitudes. Also they have this really good orange lemonade. Just try it."
